You are solely responsible for your use of any such websites or resources. Also, if we provide you with any Software under an open source license, there may be provisions in those licenses that conflict with the Agreement, in which case the open source provisions will apply with respect to the code to which those provisions apply.
Billing
Unless otherwise indicated on an Order Form or Statement of Work ( SOW ), all fees will be due and payable upon commencement of the Services ( Service Fees ). If you fail to pay Service Fees within five (5) business days of notice to you that payment is due or delinquent, or if you do not update payment information upon request, we may suspend or terminate access to the Services by you or your Authorized Users.
You will pay all applicable sales, use, service, value-added, consumption or other taxes associated with the Services you purchase. Outreach will pay all taxes on its income and all taxes and insurance associated with its personnel.
Payments made by credit card or debit card may be billed and processed by an agent on behalf of Outreach. Such agent shall act solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Outreach and shall not be construed to be providing the Service. If you mandate the use of any specific payment portal or other processing agent which charges a fee to Outreach of any kind, you shall be invoiced the cost of such fee and obligated to pay it.
After the Initial Term, the Service Fees are subject to change and may be changed upon notice to you at least sixty (60) days prior to the start of any Renewal Term (as defined below).
Term and Termination; Suspension
The Agreement shall begin on the effective date as specified in your Order ( Order Effective Date ) and shall continue as specified in your Order (the  Initial Term ), automatically renewing thereafter for successive periods of twelve months each (each a  Renewal Term  and together with the Initial Term, the  Term ) unless earlier terminated. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the Services in whole or part at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, without incurring liability of any kind. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with the Agreement, or if you use the Services in any way that may cause us legal liability or disrupt others' use of the Services or damage to our business or reputation, or for any other reason. If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating the Agreement, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend or terminate immediately. You acknowledge that if your access to the Services is suspended or terminated, you may no longer have access to Your Data that is stored with the Service. Either Party may terminate the autorenewal of the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party, which notice is given at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the applicable then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as the case may be.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE EXPRESS WARRANTIES MADE IN THIS SECTION, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUTREACH DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.
Indemnification
Your indemnity to us: You will defend and hold us and our affiliates, employees, officers, directors, agents, successors and assigns, harmless at your own expense, against any and all third party liability (including damages, recoveries, deficiencies, interest, penalties and legal fees), directly or indirectly arising from or in connection with: (i) Your Data; (ii) your violation of any third party rights (including third party intellectual property rights or privacy rights); and (iii) your use of the Services in any way contrary to the Agreement.
Our indemnity to you: We will defend and hold you and your employees, officers, directors, agents, successors and assigns, harmless at our own expense, against any and all third party liability (including damages, recoveries, deficiencies, interest, penalties and legal fees), directly or indirectly arising from or in connection with any third party claims that the Services infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of a third party.
The Party seeking indemnification under the Agreement will: (i) give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice of the claim, (ii) tender to the indemnifying Party control of the defense and settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperate with the indemnifying Party in defending or settling the claim. The indemnified Party will have the right to participate at its own expense in any indemnification action or related settlement negotiations using counsel of its own choice. Neither Party may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that adversely affects the rights or interests of the other Party without that Partys prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld.
Limitation of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OUTREACH, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT OUTREACH HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF OUTREACH TO YOU, ANY AFFILIATE OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR CONNECTED WITH THE AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE DAMAGES THEORY, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID OR OWING TO OUTREACH UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVIDED IN THIS PARAGRAPH WILL APPLY IN THE AGGREGATE TO YOU AND YOUR AFFILIATES AND SHALL NOT BE CUMULATIVE. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PARAGRAPH IS TO PROVIDE FOR THE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES PAID, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF WE WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY THAN PROVIDED FOR HEREIN.
Some states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS, OUTREACHS LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
In addition, Outreach and its authorized personnel may require access to Your Data or account for the purposes of assisting you with any step of your account setup or any other troubleshooting, including attaining email connectivity. Neither Outreach nor any of its employees will be liable in cases where this access exposes us to your private data, including prospect info and email metadata and content. By using Outreach, you agree to permit Outreach representatives these permissions only when circumstances necessitate it. We reserve the right to assist in these ways when needed and will keep information confidential as per our
Privacy Policy .
Modifications
We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. We will notify you of any change (for example via email to the email address associated with your account or by a notification when you sign in or by some other method). By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, simply don't use the Services after the change is effective, in which case the change will not apply to you.
Miscellaneous Legal Terms
Neither Party will be liable for any delay or default in its performance of any obligation under the Agreement (other than a payment obligation) caused directly or indirectly by fire, flood, act of God, acts of government, an act or omission of civil or military authority of a state or nation, strike, lockout or other labor problem, inability to secure, delay in securing or shortage of, labor, materials, supplies, transportation or energy, failures of suppliers, or by war, riot, embargo or civil disturbance, breakdown, or destruction of plant or equipment arising from any cause whatsoever, or any cause or causes beyond such Partys reasonable control (collectively, Force Majeure Events). This provision will in no way impair either Partys right to terminate this Agreement. The Agreement and the use of the Services will be governed by Washington law except for its conflicts of laws principles. All claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the Services must be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Washington, and both Parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. These Terms, together with the associated Order, constitute the entire and exclusive Agreement between you and Outreach with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services. The Agreement creates no third party beneficiary rights. Outreach's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted to reflect our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under the Agreement, and any such attempt is void, but Outreach may assign its rights and obligations to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business or assets associated with the Services. Outreach may identify you as a customer in general listings of customers that Outreach may make available on its website or in promotional or marketing materials. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Agreement, all notices given to the Parties under the Agreement will be in writing and will be given by nationally recognized overnight courier service, certified mail (return receipt requested), facsimile with electronic confirmation or personal delivery, if to you at the address indicated on the applicable Order, and if to
