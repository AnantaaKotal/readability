March 31, 2011 Datadog Service Terms and Agreement These Service Terms and Agreement, together with the Subscription (as defined in Section 2 below), are an agreement (collectively, this Agreement) between Datadog, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Datadog), and the individual or company identified in the Subscription (Customer). BY SIGNING UP TO ACCESS THE DATADOG SERVICE YOU ARE REPRESENTING THAT YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 18, HAVE THE CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ARE CONSENTING ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND/OR AS AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR COMPANY, AS APPLICABLE, TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, Datadog and Customer agree as follows: Description.
Datadog runs a monitoring service intended for IT, operations and development teams which includes the features and functionality described at the datadoghq.com website (the Site) on the Subscription Date, as such features and functionality may change from time to time as provided in Section 6 (the Service). The Service is operated on Datadogs hosting servers or those of its provider(s) to enable Customer and those of its employees who have been authorized by Customer (Authorized Users) to access and use the Service via the web. (If Customer is an individual subscribing for personal use, the term Authorized User shall refer to him or her.) Subscription and Subscription Date.
As used in this Agreement, the term Subscription means (a) an online order for the Service completed and submitted by Customer through the Site and accepted by Datadog, (b) a written Customer purchase order for the Service accepted by Datadog, (c) another written agreement for the Service executed by both Datadog and Customer, or (d) an order for the Service by Customer through an authorized Datadog reseller. Subscription Date refers to, as applicable, (i) the date Customer submits its online order through the Site, (ii) the date Customer issues its written purchase order, (iii) the date both Customer and Datadog have executed a written agreement, or (iv) the date that an authorized Datadog reseller has commenced the Services on behalf of a Customer. Term. (a) This Agreement shall commence on the Subscription Date and, unless terminated early in accordance with Section 7 or 14 below, continue for (i) the number of months or year(s) specified in the Subscription as measured from the first day of the first calendar month after the Subscription Date, or (ii) if no period is specified in the Subscription, the end of the calendar month following the calendar month in which Customer gives notice of termination pursuant to this Section 3 (the Initial Period). This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive renewal periods of the same duration of the Initial Period (each, a Renewal Period) unless one party gives notice of termination or non-renewal pursuant to this Section 3 (the Initial Period, and all such Renewal Periods, collectively, the Service Period). (b) If Customer is using the Service under a Pro, Enterprise or other fee-based pricing plan (each, a Paying Plan), this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive renewal periods of the same duration of the Initial Period unless one party gives notice to the other of its intent not to renew at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then pending term. If Customer is using the Service under a Free or non-paying Trial plan (each, a Free Plan), this Agreement will be deemed month-to-month and either party shall be free to not renew, or to terminate, this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer has purchased the Services through an authorized Datadog reseller, the terms of Customers subscription with such reseller shall control with respect to the subscription term; provided, however, that if Datadog and such applicable reseller terminate their agreement, the Services will immediately terminate unless Customer enters into a new subscription with Datadog or another authorized reseller. Pricing and Fees. (a) Unless the parties agree otherwise in a separately executed written agreement for an Enterprise or other customized Paying Plan, fees for the Service (Fees) shall be based on the pricing published at the Site as of the Subscription Date for the Initial Period. All or certain of the Fees may be calculated on the basis of the number of hosts. For purposes of that determination and this Agreement, the term host refers to a concurrently monitored host/server, as determined by Datadog on a calendar month basis. (b) Customer must be authorized to use the payment method Customer enters when creating a billing account. Customer authorizes Datadog to charge Customer for the Service using that payment method and for any paid feature of the Service that Customer chooses to sign up for or use during the Service Period of this Agreement. As indicated in a Subscription, Datadog may bill: (i) in advance; (ii) at the time of purchase; (iii) shortly after purchase; or (iv) on a recurring time- or usage-based basis. (c) Customer must keep all information in Customers billing account current. Customer can access and modify Customers billing account information through the Site and may change its payment method at any time. If Customer notifies Datadog to stop using Customers previously designated payment method and fails to designate an alternative, Datadog may immediately suspend use and access to the Service. Any notice from Customer changing its billing account will not affect charges Datadog submits to Customers billing account before Datadog reasonably could act on Customers request. (d) Datadog will notify Customer in advance, either through the Service or by email pursuant to Section 18(b), if Datadog changes Fees that would apply to Customer in a Renewal Period. If Customer does not agree to these changes, Customer must give notice of its intent to not renew the Agreement for such Renewal Period and stop using the Service on or before the effective date of termination. If Customer fails to give notice of non-renewal, Customers payment information on file will be charged at the new Fees thereafter. (e) Payments for all accounts registered to pay via credit card are due the date the invoice is posted on Customers account. Payments for all accounts registered to pay via check, wire transfer or Automated Clearing House (ACH) are due within 30 days of the invoice date unless otherwise agreed-to by the parties in writing. If any payment is not made when due, Datadog may immediately suspend use and access to the Service. (f) All Customer prepayments, if any, for the Service (monthly, yearly or otherwise) shall be deemed fully earned upon payment and are non-refundable; this includes accounts that are renewed. (g) If this Agreement is terminated early by Customer pursuant to Section 7 or 14(a), or by Datadog pursuant to Section 14(b)(ii), Customer will not be obligated to pay the Fees following the effective date of termination. In all other cases, and regardless of whether Customer and its Authorized Users access or use the Service at the levels reflected in the Subscription or otherwise, Customer is responsible for paying all Fees through expiration of the Service Period. (h) Any amount not paid when due will bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, computed and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid. Further, in the event of any action by Datadog to collect any amount not paid when due, Customer will pay or reimburse Datadogs costs of collection (including, without limitation, any attorneys fees and court costs). (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer has purchased the Services through an authorized Datadog reseller, the terms of Customers subscription with such reseller shall control with respect to all pricing and fees; provided, however, that Datadog may suspend or terminate Services to Customer if such applicable reseller has not paid the applicable fees due from reseller to Datadog for Customers use of the Services. Taxes.
All Fees are exclusive of any applicable sales or other taxes or similar fees imposed by any government authority. Customer will (a) pay or reimburse all such taxes and fees (including any interest or penalties), if any, due, based on or measured by amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement (excluding taxes based on Datadogs net income) or (b) furnish Datadog with evidence acceptable to the government authority to sustain an exemption therefrom. Service Access and Use Rights.
Subject to this Agreement, Datadog will make the Service available to Customer and Authorized Users during the Service Period and Datadog hereby grants to Customer, during the Service Period, a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited right to enable Authorized Users to access and use the Service through the interface and the Site, and to access and use Datadogs technical and operations documentation and Agents (as defined in Section 9) in support thereof, solely for Customers internal, business use. Customer acknowledges that its and each Authorized Users access and use of the Service are subject to Datadogs
Privacy Policy , which is published at the Site and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Datadog may delegate the performance of certain portions of the Service to third parties, but will remain responsible to Customer for delivery thereof. Datadog may in its discretion modify, enhance or otherwise change the Service from time to time, provided that, if Customer is under a Paying Plan, such change does not adversely affect the Service as it existed at the Subscription Date. Service Level Commitment.
Excluding scheduled maintenance windows, Datadog will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain 99.8% availability of the hosted portion of the Service for each calendar month during the term of this Agreement. The Service will be deemed available so long as Authorized Users are able to login to the Service interface and access monitoring data. Excluding planned maintenance periods, in the event the Service availability drops below 99.8% for two consecutive months, Customer may terminate the Service in the calendar month following such two-month period upon written notice to Datadog. To assess uptime, Customer may, if under a Paying Plan, request the Service availability for a prior month by filing a support ticket through the Site. Support.
Subject to this Agreement, if Customer is under a Paying Plan, Datadog will provide unlimited in-product and email support (Support). Although no response times are guaranteed, Datadog will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such support requests within 48 hours. Datadog may delegate the performance of certain portions of the Support to third parties, but will remain responsible to Customer for delivery thereof. In the event any Support is not performed with reasonable skill, care and diligence, Datadog will re-perform the Support to the extent necessary to correct the defective performance, and Customer acknowledges that re-performance shall be Customers sole and exclusive remedy for any defective performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer has purchased the Services through an authorized Datadog reseller, such reseller shall be responsible for Tier 1 support and any other support terms set forth in Customers subscription with such reseller. Agents; Third-Party Content.
Datadog will make various application program interfaces (APIs), agents, libraries and other materials available at the Site or through the Service from time to time in its discretion to support Customers access and use of the Service (collectively, Agents). Customer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Agents may only be used on systems owned, leased or primarily operated by Customer, (b) the Agents are made available solely to support access and use of the Service, and Datadog has no liability with respect to any other uses of the Agents, and (c) certain of the Agents may include third-party content that is subject to open source license terms that may expand or limit Customers rights to use such content. Customer agrees to review any electronic documentation that accompanies the Agents or is identified in a link provided to Customer to determine which portions of the Agents are open source and are licensed under open source license terms. To the extent any such license terms require that Datadog provide Customer the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any open source software in the Agents that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to Customer in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable open source license terms shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such open source software. Further, Customer acknowledges and agrees that all third-party content is governed by its respective terms and such terms are solely between Customer and the applicable licensor. Customer agrees to comply with such third-party terms (including open source license terms), as applicable, and Datadog has no liability with respect to third-party content under this Agreement.

Customer is solely responsible for tracking and for ensuring the security and confidentiality of all user identifiers and passwords. Datadog has no liability with respect to any use or misuse of such identifiers or passwords, and any use thereof other than as provided in this Agreement will be considered a breach of this Agreement by Customer.
