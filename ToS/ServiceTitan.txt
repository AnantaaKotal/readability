If you registered for the Service under a name other than the legal name of a business, we may from time to time require you to verify that all licenses purchased by you are used in the operation of a single business. If you are using multiple Managed Technicians accounts in connection with the operation of more than one business, you must disclose this fact to us at time of registration and renewal for the Service. Failure to do so will constitute a breach of your obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 2. License (a) License Grant.

By way of example only, if you have 10 employees in your company, and if you have only paid for 3 Managed Technician licenses, you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to have up to 3 individuals only access the Service as Managed Technicians, without substitution. Use of the Service by any number of individuals above the number of Managed Technician licenses you have purchased as part of your subscription is a violation of your Agreement. Any number of individuals using the Service in excess of the number of Managed Technician licenses you have subscribed to will be subject to immediate additional subscription purchases to the payment method on file, pro rated for any partial period.

Monthly billing will be based upon the number of Managed Technicians at the beginning of the period, plus prorated billing for any added Managed Technicians and without reduction for users removed during the period.

Dispute Resolution (a) Generally . In the interest of resolving disputes between you and ServiceTitan in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 19(b) and (c), you and ServiceTitan agree that every dispute arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SERVICETITAN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. (b) Exceptions . Despite the provisions of Section 19(a), nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. (c) Opt-Out . If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 19 within 30 days after the date that you agree to this Agreement by sending a letter to ServiceTitan, Inc., 801 N. Brand Blvd., Suite 700, Glendale, CA 91203 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (Opt-Out Notice). Once ServiceTitan receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 19 will be void and any action arising out of this Agreement will be resolved as set forth in Section 20. The remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. (d) Arbitrator . Any arbitration between you and ServiceTitan will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,  AAA Rules ) as modified by this
Agreement . The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at
www.adr.org , by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting ServiceTitan. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. (e) Notice of Arbitration; Process . A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ( Notice of Arbitration ). ServiceTitans address for Notice is: ServiceTitan, Inc., 801 N. Brand Blvd., Suite 700 Glendale, CA 91203. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (Demand). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or ServiceTitan may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or ServiceTitan must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by ServiceTitan in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, ServiceTitan will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000. (f) Fees . If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, ServiceTitan will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse ServiceTitan for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrators ruling on the merits. (g) No Class Actions . YOU AND SERVICETITAN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and ServiceTitan agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one persons claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. (h) Modifications to this Arbitration Provision .
If ServiceTitan makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to ServiceTitans address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to ServiceTitans address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with ServiceTitan will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive. (i) Enforceability . If Section 19(g) or the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, or if ServiceTitan receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement. 20.
