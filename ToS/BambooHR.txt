Terms of Service
When you use BambooHR ®
these are the Terms of Service.
Privacy Policy
Refund Policy
Terms of Service
Data Processing Agreement
Last Updated: April 20, 2020
YOUR USE OF THE PROPRIETARY BAMBOOHR ®
SERVICE OFFERED AT BAMBOOHR.COM (THE SERVICE), IS SUBJECT TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. IN ORDER TO USE THE SERVICE, YOU MUST AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (AGREEMENT) WITH BAMBOO HR LLC AND/OR BAMBOOHR PAYROLL LLC (BAMBOOHR). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICE.
The BambooHR® Privacy Policy (available
here ) is incorporated herein by reference. This Agreement governs your use of the Service however accessed, including via an Internet browser, smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device.
By signing up for the Service on behalf of a client of BambooHR, you confirm that (a) you are duly authorized to represent the entity, (b) you accept the terms of this Agreement on behalf of such entity, and (c) any references to you in this Agreement refer to such entity and all of its employees, consultants and agents. You are responsible for all activity on the Service that occurs under your account.
The Service
1.1
The BambooHR ®
Service may include additional services that you subscribe to receive specifically from or through BambooHR (Additional Services). Some of these Additional Services have specific additional terms that apply to your use of those Additional Services (the Additional Terms), and those Additional Terms become part of this Agreement. In the event an Additional Term directly conflicts with any term in this Agreement, the Additional Term will apply to your use of the Additional Services instead of the term contained in this Agreement.
Term and Termination
2.1
This Agreement will remain in effect as long as you have an active subscription for the Service (the Term). If you elect to use the Service for a free trial period, and do not purchase a subscription before the end of such period, this Agreement will expire at the end of the free trial period.
2.2
Subscriptions purchased by you commence on the start date specified when you complete the initial payment process and continue for the subscription term selected at the time of payment. If you add an additional subscription for a new BambooHR ®
service or module at a later date, the new service will commence on the start date specified at the time you added the new service and continue for the subscription term selected at that time. Subscriptions automatically renew, as described in Section 5.1.
2.3
You are solely responsible for the proper cancellation of your subscription. You may cancel your subscription at any time by emailing
[email protected]
or calling 1-866-387-9595.
2.4
BambooHR may suspend your access to the Service and terminate this Agreement and your use of the Service at any time in the event you materially breach this Agreement (including failure to pay, which may occur if your credit card cannot be charged) and you do not cure such breach within 30 days of BambooHR providing you with written notice of such breach (including notice by email), or earlier if a specific subscription or Additional Terms provides otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BambooHR may immediately suspend or terminate your access to the Service without liability if you are in violation of Sections 4.1, 4.5 or 13 of this Agreement, as determined by BambooHR in its sole discretion. BambooHR may also downgrade, suspend or terminate your access to the Service without liability, after providing you with 30 days advance written notice, if (a) you fail to affirmatively agree to material modifications of this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.1 below, or (b) you do not log in to or otherwise use the Service for a period of 180 days or more if you have a paid account and for a period of 60 days or more if you have a free account. For instances other than non-payment or violation of Section 4.1, in the event you cancel one or more of your subscriptions or this Agreement is terminated by BambooHR or you, BambooHR will refund to you any prepaid fees covering any period of the Term remaining after the effective date of termination for all such subscriptions, except that no refunds will be granted for the then-current month. Notice via email from BambooHR will be sent to you at the email address you have provided to us. BambooHR reserves the right to manage its client profile, the risks it will assume, the industries it will serve, and the locations where it will do business, including choosing to not provide services to certain groups parties, industries, or companies in certain countries, in its sole discretion.
2.5
In the event your subscription is terminated, other than in instances where it is terminated by BambooHR for your nonpayment or violation of Sections 4.1 or 13, you will continue to have the ability to download the information provided, inputted or uploaded to your databases in the BambooHR ®
Service by you or on your behalf (Data) for 30 days after the effective date of expiration or termination of your subscription. After such 30-day period or if your subscription is terminated due to your nonpayment or violation of Section 4.1, BambooHR shall have no obligation to maintain any Data and shall thereafter, unless legally prohibited to do so, or required pursuant to Additional Terms, delete all of your Data contained in the BambooHR ®
Service.
Modification of Service or this Agreement
3.1
The Service may be made available in free or paid versions at different levels. Not all features and functionality of the Service may be available in each version or level. BambooHR reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, add, or remove portions and/or functionality of the Service on a temporary or permanent basis, without liability to you or any third party.
3.2
BambooHR may modify or update this Agreement at any time. In the event BambooHR determines it is necessary to make a material modification to this Agreement, you will be notified of such change and asked to affirmatively agree to such modified version of the Agreement. Note, however, that your use of the Service after modifications to the Agreement become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. You may review the most current version of this Agreement at:
https://www.bamboohr.com/terms-of-service/ .
3.3
If you are dissatisfied with the terms of this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement or the Service, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is to terminate your subscription and discontinue any use of the Service.
Usage Rights; Restrictions; Support
4.1
During the Term, BambooHR grants you a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive right to access and use the hosted software products and related documentation included in the Service and all modifications and/or enhancements to any of the foregoing (collectively, the Software) via a web browser or other device owned or controlled by you for your internal business use. Nothing in this Agreement obligates BambooHR to deliver or make available any copies of computer programs or code from the Software to you, whether in object code or source code form. You agree to use the Service only in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations (Applicable Law). You shall not, and shall not agree to, and shall not authorize, encourage or permit any third party to:
1) use the Service to upload, transmit or otherwise distribute any content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing,
abusive, fraudulent, obscene, threatening, abusive, hateful, contains viruses, or is otherwise objectionable as reasonably determined by BambooHR;
2) use the Service for any fraudulent or inappropriate purpose, or in a manner for which it is not intended to be used (as determined by BambooHR in its sole discretion);
3) attempt to decipher, decompile, delete, alter or reverse engineer any of the Software;
4) duplicate, make derivative works of, reproduce or exploit any part of the Service without the express written permission of BambooHR;
5) use any robot, spider, other automated device, or manual process to monitor or copy any content from the Service other than copying or exporting of the Data as contemplated in the documentation; or
6) rent, lease, distribute, or resell the Software, or access or use the Software or Services for developing a competitive solution (or contract with a third party to do so), or remove or alter any of the logos, trademark, patent or copyright notices, confidentiality or proprietary legends or other notices or markings that are on or in the Software or displayed in connection with the Service.
4.2
BambooHR shall: (i) provide you with basic support in connection with your use of the Service at no additional charge, and with upgraded support if purchased separately, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (a) planned downtime (which BambooHR shall schedule to the extent practicable after business hours Mountain Daylight Time on Thursdays), (b) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond BambooHRs reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of government, floods, fires, earthquakes, pandemics, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than those involving our employees), Internet service provider failures or delays, or denial of service attacks, or (c) as necessary to update the Service to ensure its security and integrity and (iii) provide the Service only in accordance with Applicable Law.
BambooHRs hours for basic support are 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Mountain Daylight Time, on weekdays, in the English language via telephone, email and chat.
Also, while BambooHR would like to offer the Service in a manner that accommodates all customers in their native language, this is not practical considering the constant updating we do with our Service, the vast number of languages spoken and read in the world, and the localizations that would be required.
BambooHR therefore provides much of its Service in English, with limited adaptations to certain major languages, which adaptations are made in its sole discretion.
4.3
BambooHR shall maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the Service, and the security of your Data. BambooHR shall not (a) disclose your Data except as compelled by Applicable Law or as you expressly authorize in writing, or (b) access your Data except to provide the Service and prevent or address service or technical problems, or at your express request in connection with customer support matters. In the event BambooHR is compelled by Applicable Law to disclose your Data, we will provide you with notice thereof, (in advance, if possible) if permitted by Applicable Law.
4.4
You are solely responsible for your Data, and all uses of your Data that occur through your account.
4.5
IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE AND PAY FOR A TEST ACCOUNT (A LIMITED TIME AND USAGE BAMBOOHR ACCOUNT USED FOR TESTING THE SERVICE), YOU AGREE THAT YOUR TEST ACCOUNT WILL NOT BE USED WITH LIVE OR REAL DATA AND ACCEPT THAT BAMBOOHR MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THAT ACCOUNT.
4.6
If you integrate with BambooHR using our API, you must use efficient programming, which will not cause an excessive number of requests to be made in too short a period of time, as-determined solely by BambooHR. If this occurs, BambooHR reserves the right to throttle your API connections or suspend or terminate your BambooHR account.
Payment Terms
5.1
Your subscription to the Service renews automatically for the same term selected upon initial payment (e.g., month-to-month, annual, etc.). You may change your subscription term at any time by contacting BambooHR using one of the methods set forth in the Contact Information section below. If you are paying by credit card, your credit card will be charged once a month for monthly subscriptions and at the time your annual subscription payment has been depleted based on your number of employees and subscription to the Service. BambooHR will email you a receipt when your card has been charged. If your card cannot be charged, BambooHR will notify you and you will need to update your payment information. In the event you do not update your payment information within 22 days of BambooHRs notice, your access to the Service may be suspended and you will need to update your card information in order to resume use of the Service. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service.
5.2
Annual subscription pricing requires a one-year minimum commitment. If you cancel your full subscription, or your subscription is suspended for nonpayment, before the end of the one-year commitment period, you will no longer qualify for annual subscription pricing and you will be charged the difference between the monthly and annual commitment pricing for the number of months your subscription was active. If you cancel only a portion of your subscription, you may still qualify for annual pricing and the prepaid amounts attributed to that portion will be used against other services to which you have subscribed.
5.3
All fees are exclusive of all taxes or duties imposed by governing authorities. Other than sales taxes which BambooHR may be required to collect from you and remit to appropriate taxing authorities, you are solely responsible for payment of all such taxes or duties.
5.4
BambooHR may at any time, upon notice of at least 90 days, or a longer period if required by Applicable Law, change the price of your subscription or any part thereof, or institute new charges or fees. Price changes and institution of new charges implemented during your annual subscription period will go into effect for any subsequent annual subscription periods and to all new subscribers after the effective date of the change. If you do not agree to any such price changes, then you must cancel your subscription and stop using the Service prior to the commencement of the renewal subscription period for which the price change applies.
Intellectual Property Rights
6.1
As between the parties, BambooHR owns and shall retain all right, title and interest in and to (a) the Software and the Service, including all intellectual property rights therein, and (b) all transactional and performance data related to your use of the Service.

6.2

From time to time during the Term, BambooHR may develop, author or prepare custom documents, designs, computer programs, computer documentation and other tangible materials (Deliverables) for you pursuant to agreement between you and BambooHR.

BambooHR may reuse any Deliverables, provided that such use does not reveal your identity, your confidential information or any personally identifiable information that belongs to you or your employees.
