7. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
a. Please Contact Us First: Our goal is for you to be happy and satisfied with your use of the Enterprise Services. If you have a dispute with Lookout, you agree to contact us at
enterprisesupport@lookout.com
and attempt, in good faith, to resolve the dispute with us informally. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days of notice, you or Lookout may bring a formal proceeding.
b. You Agree to Arbitrate: To the extent allowable under the laws of your jurisdiction, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the use of the Enterprise Services, this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be submitted before one arbitrator for final and binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, or other location to which both parties agree to in writing. The arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (collectively, the JAMS Rules), both of which are available at the JAMS website
www.jamsadr.com . Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting an arbitrator from the JAMS panel of neutrals and in scheduling the proceedings. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with any arbitration arising out of or related to use of the Enterprise Services or this Agreement. If the arbitrator determines a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the arbitrator may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.
c. Exception to Arbitration: Either party may bring a lawsuit in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights without first engaging in the informal dispute notice process described above.
d. U.S. Licensees Only - Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding: You and Lookout agree that any arbitration will be limited to the dispute between Lookout and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND LOOKOUT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Lookout otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one persons claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then Subsections 7(b)-(d) will be deemed null and void.
e. California Provides the Governing Law and Jurisdiction for This TOS: This TOS will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. Both parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in San Francisco County, California for any actions not subject to arbitration and you and the Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
8. General Matters
a. Severability: If any provision of this TOS is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent. If no such modification is possible, that provision will be severed from this TOS and this TOS will otherwise remain in full force and effect.
b. No Waiver: Our failure or delay to enforce a provision under these Terms is not a waiver of our right to do so in the future.
c. No Assignment or Transfer: This TOS and any rights and licenses that we grant to you may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned or transferred by Lookout without restriction.
d. Entire Agreement: These Terms will constitute the entire agreement between you and Lookout concerning the Enterprise Services unless your Enterprise has a master license agreement with Lookout which incorporates end user terms of service. If your Enterprise has such a master license agreement then the terms of the master license will control over any conflicting Terms. Where these Terms do apply they supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Lookout.
e. We Can Modify This TOS: Lookout may modify these Terms from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion. You agree to be bound by any changes to the TOS if you continue to use the Enterprise Services after such changes are posted, so please read all changes carefully. The most current version of this TOS will be located at
https://www.lookout.com/legal/enterprise-user-tos .
f. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms.
g. In the Event of Termination: The provisions that require or contemplate performance after the termination of these Terms, and all provisions relating to limitation of liability, disclaimers, and indemnification in these Terms will be enforceable regardless of the termination of these Terms.
I HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING TERMS OF SERVICE AND AGREE THAT MY USE OF THE SERVICE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MY AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
