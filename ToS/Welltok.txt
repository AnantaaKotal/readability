Under no circumstances will Welltok be liable in any way for any User Content made available through the Service by you or any third party.

 Public Content  is any User Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Services (for example, comments you post on a message board). You grant Welltok a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, transferable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display your Public Content, and to incorporate your Public Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed.

 Private Content  is any User Content you submit to the Services but which is not intended to be publicly available (for example, content you input into a non-publicly displayed program on our Services, or the private information you submit when you register, other than your publicly visible user name and information in your profile that you share publicly). You grant Welltok a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, transferable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, and adapt your Private Content, and to incorporate your Private Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed, for the purposes of (i) providing the Services for which such Private Content was submitted or made available (for example, to facilitate a program in which you have elected to participate, or to notify the programs sponsor that you are eligible to receive a prize) or (ii) to create anonymized and aggregrated data repositories for analytics purposes. If your Private Content includes any Protected Health Information ( PHI ) governed by HIPAA, the foregoing license and rights granted therein are limited solely to the extent required by HIPAA, and we will not share your PHI with others unless you have opted-in for such sharing. This license will terminate at the time you remove or Welltok removes such Private Content from the Services.
 Personal Information  Depending on what you input into the Services, it is possible that Personal Information may be found within Private Content and/or Public Content. Rights and potential uses of Personal Information are set forth in our Privacy Notice.
