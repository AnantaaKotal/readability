General
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Collibra and govern your use of the Site and the Site Content, superseding any prior agreements between you and Collibra with respect to the Site and the Site Content. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party sites, content or software. These Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims arising in connection with your use of the Site and the Site Content, you and Collibra agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York County, New York. The failure of Collibra to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.  A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Use without the prior written consent of Collibra, but Collibra may assign or transfer these Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. Collibra may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Use or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Site.
