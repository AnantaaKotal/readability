If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, then you represent and agree that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to this Agreement. If you do not accept the terms of this Agreement, then you cannot use the Cloud Service. 1.3 Certain defined terms are set forth in Section 14 of this Agreement. 2. CLOUD SERVICE 2.1 Subject to payment of the applicable Fees to the Marketplace Platform Provider, Confluent grants to Customer a limited, world-wide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, right and license (without right to sublicense) to access and use the Cloud Service during the Subscription Term, solely for Customers internal business operations, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Customer is responsible for Users compliance with this Agreement. 2.2 Registration. Customer must register and setup an authorized account to use the Cloud Service.

DEFINITIONS 14.1 Cloud Service means the products that Confluent makes available through the Marketplace as a hosted, web-based service, and that are purchased by Customer. 14.2 Content means all data and information uploaded to the Cloud Service by Customer or on Customers behalf, but does not include any data Confluent collects as specified in section 2.3 (User and Performance Data). 14.3 Fees means the fees payable by Customer for the Cloud Service, as specified in the Order. 14.4 Marketplace means the third party platform through which Customer orders the Cloud Service. 14.5 Platform Provider means the Marketplace vendor with which Customer places the Order for the Cloud Service. 14.6 Order means the internet order page or an ordering document agreed upon by the parties, that specifies Customers purchase of the Cloud Service. 14.7 Subscription Term means the term of Customers authorized use of the Cloud Service, which commences on the earlier of (a) the date Customer starts using the Cloud Service, or (b) as otherwise stated in the Order. 14.8 Support Services means any support and maintenance service that Confluent may provide in connection with the Order. 14.9 User means any person under Customers control that Customer allows access to or use of the Cloud Service, and may include Customers employees, contractors, service providers, and other third parties. 14.10 User Credentials means User IDs and passwords. EXHIBIT A During your Subscription Term, Confluent will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Cloud Service available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.95% (the Service Level Objective or SLO). If Confluent does not meet this SLO, Customer will be eligible to receive a Service Credit from the Platform Provider as described below. 1. Definitions  Downtime is the total accumulated minutes during a calendar month for a given Cloud Service Kafka cluster during which the entire Kafka cluster is unavailable. A minute is considered unavailable for a given Kafka cluster if all continuous attempts by Confluents monitoring system to write to the Kafka cluster within the minute fail. (Confluents monitoring system will connect to the same Kafka endpoints that Customer uses). Downtime does not include downtime that results from any of the exclusions set forth below. Partial minutes of unavailability will not be counted as Downtime.  Monthly Uptime Percentage means the total number of minutes in a calendar month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime in such month, divided by the total number of minutes in such month. If Customers Cloud Service Kafka cluster is provisioned and running for only part of a calendar month, such cluster is deemed to be 100% available during the portion of the month in which it was not provisioned and running.  Service Credit means the percentage of monthly Fees, calculated as set forth below, credited to Customers account with the Platform Provider in accordance with the process described in this SLA. 2. Service Credits Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total monthly Fees paid by Customer for the unavailable Cloud Service Kafka cluster for the calendar month in which the Cloud Service does not meet the SLO, in accordance with the schedule below. Monthly Uptime Percentage Service Credit 99.9% but equal to or greater than 99.5% 5% 99.5% but equal to or greater than 99.0% 10% 99.0% 25% 3. Service Credit Request and Application Process To receive a Service Credit, Customer must submit a claim by logging a support ticket. To be eligible, the credit request must be received within five (5) calendar days after the last day of the month in which the Cloud Service does not meet the SLO, and must include all information reasonably necessary for Confluent to verify the claim, including: 1. the words Confluent Cloud Service SLA Credit Request in the subject line; 2. a description of the applicable Kafka client(s), the version of each such client, and the configurations for each such client; and 3. a description of the events resulting in Downtime, including the time and duration of the Downtime and Customer requests logs that document the failed write attempts. Confluent will evaluate Customer requests and determine in good faith whether a Service Credit is owed based on its system logs, monitoring reports, configuration records, and other available information. If Confluent confirms that the Monthly Uptime Percentage applicable to the month of such request did not meet the SLO, then Confluent will notify the Platform Provider and the Platform Provider will issue the Service Credit to Customer in accordance with the Customers agreement with the Platform Provider. Customers failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify Customer from receiving a Service Credit. Service credits are not refundable and can only be used toward future billing charges. Service credits are Customers sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any failure or deficiency in the Services availability. Service Credits will not entitle Customer to any payment from Confluent. Service Credits are Customers sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability of the Cloud Service in accordance with the terms of this SLA. Service credits expire without refund the earlier of twelve (12) months from issuance or one (1) month after termination of the current Subscription Term Order. 4. SLA Exclusions The SLA does not apply to any unavailability of the Cloud Service: 1. That results from (i) Customers misuse of the Confluent Cloud Enterprise Service in violation of Section 3 of the Agreement (Acceptable Use); 2. Due to factors outside Confluents reasonable control, including but not limited to any force majeure event, network intrusions, denial of service attacks, systemic internet issues or any other act or omission of any telecommunication provider, other services provider, or the Platform Provider; 3. That results from the use of services, hardware, or software provided by a third party and not within the primary control of Confluent, including issues resulting from inadequate bandwidth or resulting from region-wide failures of cloud platform services on which the Confluent Cloud Enterprise Service runs; 4. That occurs during any period when Customers use of the Cloud Service exceeds the purchased capacity specified in Customers Order; 5. That results from Customers unauthorized action or lack of action when required, including those of Customers Users or by means of Customers passwords; or 6. That results from Customers failure to use Confluent-supported Kafka clients with acceptable configuration values as defined in the Cloud Service documentation. 7. Unavailability due in whole or in part to any of the following: Customer-controlled actions and/or environment or other failures or shortcomings not within Confluents control including but not limited to the Platform Provider terminating or suspending any Order with Customer; Customers violation of the Agreement; failure by Customer to take any remedial action in relation to the Cloud Service as recommended by Confluent, or otherwise preventing Confluent from doing so; Customers negligence or willful misconduct, which may include failure to follow agreed-upon procedures; scheduled maintenance that takes place upon proper notice, ad hoc maintenance carried out to avoid future unavailability, and/or updates; or Customers failure to provide information required by Confluent to provision a cluster.
