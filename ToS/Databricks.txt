Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer acknowledges that any Reseller Order is subject to Databricks prior approval and agrees that no term in any Reseller Order will be deemed to modify the Agreement unless preauthorized in writing by Databricks.
Subscription Services .
Authorized Users .

You must obtain separate credentials (user IDs and passwords) via the Subscription Services for each Authorized User.
Your Responsibilities Regarding Authorized Users . You shall at all times be responsible for and expressly assume the risks associated with all use of the Subscription Services under an Authorized Users account (including for the payment of Fees related to such use), whether such action was taken by an Authorized User or by another party, and whether or not such action was authorized by an Authorized User, provided that such action was not (1) taken by Databricks or by a party acting under the direction of Databricks or (2) an action by a third party that Databricks should reasonably have prevented.

Additionally, to the extent Customer utilizes third party open source libraries within the Customer Instructional Input, the foregoing shall not be read to imply ownership by Customer in such libraries.
Shared Responsibility Deployment .
Generally .

Without limiting the foregoing, Customer acknowledges and agrees that (1) in order to utilize the Platform Services, Customer must have an account with the Cloud Provider; (2) Databricks does not host the Customer Cloud Environment into which the Platform Services are deployed or the Systems in which your Customer Data may be stored (e.g., an AWS S3 bucket); (3) while certain Customer Data may occasionally be present within the Platform Services (e.g., within the Customer Results), the Platform Services are not designed to archive or permanently retain Customer Data, but merely to provide an environment to facilitate Customers processing of Customer Data within the Customer Cloud Environment by permitting Customer to generate and execute Customer Instructional Input and view Customer Results; and (4) Databricks and the Platform Services do not provide backup services or disaster recovery to enable recovery of Customer Data. Accordingly, and without limiting the foregoing, but subject to Section 9.1, Databricks is not responsible for any loss, destruction, alteration, or corruption of Customer Content, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Databricks or to the extent caused by any third party that Databricks should reasonably have prevented from having access.
Customer Responsibilities .

Databricks Responsibilities . Databricks acknowledges and agrees that, as between the parties and except to the extent caused by the action or intentional or negligent inaction of Customer or Customers Authorized Users, including without limitation any customizations or configurations of the Platform Services by Customer or anything specified to be Customers responsibility in (ii), above, Databricks is primarily responsible for (1) the operation (excluding to the extent such operation is directed by the Customer Instructional Content) of the Databricks Control Plane (including the user interface of the Platform Services and the portion of the Platform Services within the Databricks Control Plane in which the Customer Instructional Input and Customer Results are held until deleted by Customer) and the Databricks software that operates the computing resources in the Customer Data Plane; and (2) implementing reasonable technical and organizational measures designed in accordance with the ISMS Standard (defined below) to protect the security of the foregoing.

Self-Paced Training Services . Databricks may make available certain Self-Paced Training Services.

Customer Data and Customer Instructional Input .
Ownership; Usage Data . As between you and Databricks, you retain all ownership rights in Customer Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Databricks may collect usage data and telemetry regarding your Authorized Users use of the Subscription Services and that such usage data may occasionally contain Customer Instructional Input (e.g., it may contain the queries entered by an Authorized User) but will not contain Customer Data or Customer Results ( Usage Data ).

Term of Order Forms . The Term of an Order Form shall be as specified in the Order Form.
Monthly PAYG Services.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Databricks may suspend or terminate any Monthly PAYG Services account, and delete any Customer Content relating to such account that may be stored within the Subscription Services or other Databricks Systems, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice (email sufficient) if Databricks reasonably determines the account is inactive as set forth in the Acceptable Use Policy.
Suspension; Termination . Databricks may temporarily suspend or terminate the Databricks Services at any time (a) immediately without notice if Databricks reasonably suspects that you have violated Section 3 or your responsibilities set forth in Section 2.2(c) in a manner that may cause material harm or material risk of harm to Databricks or to any other party, (b) upon ten (10) business days notice if Databricks reasonably suspects that you have committed any other violation of Section 3 or your responsibilities set forth in Section 2.2(c) or (c) if you or your Responsible Customer (as defined below) fail to pay undisputed Fees after receiving notice that you are more than thirty (30) days delinquent in payment.

Confidentiality; Data Protection .
Confidentiality .

Each receiving party will protect the disclosing partys Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure using efforts equivalent to the efforts that the receiving party ordinarily uses with respect to its own Confidential Information of similar nature and in no event using less than a reasonable standard of care; provided, however, that a party may disclose such Confidential Information as required by applicable law, regulation, court order or action by applicable regulatory authority, subject to the party required to make such disclosure giving reasonable notice to the other party to enable it to contest such order or requirement or limit the scope of such request. The provisions of this Section 6.1 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between the parties (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date) that would purport to address the confidentiality and security of Customer Data and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to Customer Data.
Data Protection . Databricks is certified as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 compliant as of the Effective Date and shall remain certified to this or an equivalent or greater standard (the  ISMS Standard ) throughout the term of this Agreement.

Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Customer Data under Databricks control. Without limiting the foregoing, Databricks acknowledges that it may receive or have access to Personal Data provided by your Authorized Users during the term of this Agreement. Except with respect to a free trial, the terms of the DPA are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply to the extent Customer Data includes Personal Data, as defined in the DPA. To the extent Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by Databricks, the EU-US and/or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, and/or the Standard Contractual Clauses shall apply, as further set forth in the DPA. Where the Standard Contractual Clauses are applicable according to the DPA, Customer and its applicable Affiliates are each the data exporter, and Customers acceptance of this Agreement, and Customers or an applicable Affiliates execution of an Order Form, shall be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses and Appendices.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Databricks will have no liability for any infringement or misappropriation claim of any kind if such claim arises from: (a) the public open source version of Apache Spark (located at github.com/apache/spark), if the claim of infringement or misappropriation does not allege with specificity that the infringement or misappropriation arises from the Platform Services (as opposed to Apache Spark itself); (b) the combination, operation or use of the Databricks Services with equipment, devices, software or data (including without limitation your Confidential Information) not supplied by Databricks, if a claim would not have occurred but for such combination, operation or use; or (c) your or an Authorized Users use of the Databricks Services other than in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement.

Sole Remedy for Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.
SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.5 BELOW, THE FOREGOING SECTIONS 8.1 and 8.2 STATE THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION OF DATABRICKS AND ITS LICENSORS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED OR ACTUAL INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY THE DATABRICKS SERVICES.
Conditions of Indemnification.
As a condition to an indemnifying partys (each, an  Indemnitor ) obligations under this Section 8, a party seeking indemnification (each, an  Indemnitee ) will: (a) promptly notify the Indemnitor of the claim for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification (but late notice will only relieve Indemnitor of its obligation to indemnify to the extent that it has been prejudiced by the delay); (b) grant the Indemnitor sole control of the defense (including selection of counsel) and settlement of the claim; (c) provide the Indemnitor, at the Indemnitors expense, with all assistance, information and authority reasonably required for the defense and settlement of the claim; (d) preserve and will not waive legal, professional or any other privilege attaching to any of the records, documents, or other information in relation to such claim without prior notification of consent by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor will not settle any claim in a manner that does not fully discharge the claim against an Indemnitee or that imposes any obligation on, or restricts any right of, an Indemnitee without the Indemnitees prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. An Indemnitee has the right to retain counsel, at the Indemnitees expense, to participate in the defense or settlement of any claim. The Indemnitor will not be liable for any settlement or compromise that an Indemnitee enters into without the Indemnitors prior written consent.
Limitation of Liability .
Nothing in this Agreement shall limit either partys liability for
the Excluded Claims; or
any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable Laws.
Subject to Section 9.1, neither party nor its Affiliates shall be liable for any:
loss of profits or revenue;
loss from damage to business or goodwill;
loss arising from inaccurate or unexpected results of algorithms submitted by the other party to the Databricks Services; or
other indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damages; even if a party has been advised of the possibility of such losses or damages arising
SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.1, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TOGETHER WITH ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREUNDER FOR THE DATABRICKS SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, BUT WILL NOT LIMIT CUSTOMERS AND ITS AFFILIATES PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FEES AND PAYMENT SECTION ABOVE.
Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, but subject to Section 9.1, any liability relating to Databricks Services provided free of charge, including any Beta Services or Databricks Services provided during a free trial period, shall be limited to five thousand US dollars (USD $5,000).
Export . The Databricks Services, and/or derivatives thereof, may be subject to export Laws of the United States and other jurisdictions. Each party represents that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list.

Equitable Relief.
Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other party may be irreparably harmed in the event that such party breaches Section 6 (Confidentiality), and that monetary damages alone cannot fully compensate the non-breaching party for such harm. Accordingly, each party hereto hereby agrees that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent or stop such breach, and to obtain specific enforcement thereof. Any such equitable remedies obtained shall be in addition to, and not foreclose, any other remedies that may be available.

Entire Agreement, Construction, Amendment
and
Execution.
This Agreement (including all Order Forms) is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. To the extent any provision in an Order Form clearly conflicts with a provision of these Terms or a provision of an earlier Order Form, the provision in the new Order Form shall be binding and the conflicting provision in these Terms or in the earlier Order Form shall be deemed modified solely to the extent reasonably necessary to eliminate the conflict and solely with respect to the new Order Form (unless expressly intended to permanently amend the Agreement). If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The headings in this Agreement are solely for convenience, and shall not be taken into consideration in interpretation of the Agreement. Each party acknowledges and agrees that it has adequate sophistication, including legal representation, to fully review and understand this Agreement; therefore, in interpretation of the Agreement with respect to any drafting ambiguities that may be identified or alleged, no presumption shall be given in favor of the non-drafting party. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by mutual written agreement of the parties. Without limiting the foregoing, no Customer purchase order shall be deemed to modify an Order Form or this Agreement unless expressly pre-authorized in writing by Databricks. This Agreement (including all Order Forms) may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same instrument. A partys electronic signature or transmission of any document by electronic means shall be deemed to bind such party as if signed and transmitted in physical form.
Assignment.
No assignment, novation or transfer of a partys rights and obligations under this Agreement ( Assignment ) is permitted except with the prior written approval of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that either party may freely make an Assignment to a successor in interest upon a change of Control.
Notice.
Any required notice under this Agreement shall be deemed given when received by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or recorded prepaid mail. Unless notified in writing of a change of address, you shall send any required notice to Databricks, Inc., 160 Spear Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, attention: Legal Department, and Databricks shall send any required notice to you directed to the most recent address you have provided to Databricks for such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice as required under Section 4.4 may be provided by email sent to a person the party providing notice reasonably believes to have responsibility for the other partys activities under this Agreement.
Force Majeure.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Customer understands and agrees that its use of the Databricks Services may be interrupted by circumstances beyond Databricks reasonable control, including without limitation acts of God, acts of government, changes in law or regulations, acts or omissions of third parties, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, wars, acts of terror, strikes or other actions taken by labor organizations, computer, telecommunications, the Internet, Internet service provider or hosting facility failures or delays involving hardware, software or power systems not within Databricks possession or reasonable control, and network intrusions or denial of service attacks, or any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to any of the foregoing that is beyond Databricks reasonable control (individually or collectively as applicable,  Force Majeure ). Databricks shall not be responsible or otherwise liable for any Force Majeure or any consequences thereof.
