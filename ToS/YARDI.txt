In the event of a conflict between the applicable Privacy Policy and these

and warrant that your Information and Materials: (a) do not and will not,

illegal or harmful activities; and (e) are not illegal, unlawful or contrary to
the international, national, federal, state, provincial, or local laws or

7.3            Communications.  Although
Yardi provides a platform through the Site and the Services through which Users
may communicate with various other users, property managers, owners,
advertisers, or other persons or entities (collectively, a third-party) (the
communications), Yardi is not involved in those third-party communications
and is not responsible or liable under any circumstances for the content of any
third-party communications, or for any absence of communications by a
third-party. The contents of such third-party communications are determined
solely by the third-party responsible for the communications, and not Yardi.
Yardi is only responsible for the content of information issued directly by
Yardi. You acknowledge and agree that you will address any issues or concerns
about third-party communications with the responsible third-party by contacting
said third-party directly and not Yardi. Yardi shall not become involved in any
matters pertaining to third-party communications except where the issue is solely
attributable to a malfunction or error occurring on the Site or in connection
with the Services.
7.4            Renter
Screening.  As part of the Services, Users may be permitted to submit
information through the Site for the purpose of conducting a User background
check or screening on behalf of a property manager or owner (a Screening).
Information that you submit through the Site for the purpose of such Screening
shall be treated in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Your submission of the
information requested for a Screening shall constitute your consent to the
Screening process. Screenings also may be governed by other Yardi Requirements
as may be disclosed to you in connection with the Screening. You acknowledge
that you will address any issues or concerns with any Screenings, including the
results of any Screenings, by contacting the appropriate property manager or
owner, or as otherwise permitted under the Yardi Requirements applicable to the
Screening or as otherwise required by law. Yardi shall not become involved in
Screening related issues except where the issue is solely attributable to a
malfunction or error occurring on the Site or in connection with the Services
or as otherwise specified in the Yardi Requirements applicable to the Screening
or as otherwise required by law.
7.5            Payments.  Except
as expressly provided below, any payments you submit through the Site including
rental deposits, rental payments, or any other services or transactions, are
for services provided by a property manager, owner or a party other than Yardi.
The total payment amounts required for those transactions are determined solely
by you and any other party with whom you are entering into an agreement, and
not by Yardi. You acknowledge that you will address any discrepancies, issues
or concerns with such payments by contacting the other party directly, rather
than Yardi. Yardi shall not be involved in such issues except where the issue
is solely attributable to a malfunction or error occurring on the Site or in
connection with the Services. However, Users may take advantage of certain
Services that have a charge associated with them such as screening services,
lease execution fees, and the like, that is imposed by Yardi or other
third-party, which may or may not be a subsidiary or affiliate of Yardi. Yardi
or such other company may collect these fees directly from Users as provided by
the Site or the Services. You acknowledge these fees are subject to change.
Services-specific terms may set out further terms applying to such payments (including in relation to refunds (if any), billing arrangements and any consequences of failing to make timely payments). Application fees are non-refundable, even if an application is denied, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. You must comply with all such terms in relation to such payments by you.
By providing your card or bank information, you are representing that you are authorized to use this card or bank account for payments for rental deposits, rental payments, or any other services or transactions for services provided by a property manager, property owner or a party other than Yardi.  If you are making a one-time payment, your card or bank information will not be stored after completion of the transaction, but any other personal information provided in connection with the transaction will be stored.  If you are enrolling in recurring payments, you authorize Yardi to store your card or bank information to process your recurring payments. You are responsible for keeping your card or bank information up to date. If your card or bank information changes, you agree to promptly update your information. Yardi will continue to store your card or bank information until you delete your information or you cancel recurring payments.  For more information about how we store and use your card, bank or other personal information, please see our Privacy Policy.
7.6            Rental
Agreements.  Any rental agreements that you enter into through the Site
(including but not limited to those agreements for which you electronically
sign a lease or rental agreement) are for services provided by a property
manager, owner or another party other than Yardi. Although Yardi provides the
Site as a platform for the Services through which Users may execute rental or
lease agreements and enter into binding contracts with third parties, Yardi is
not involved in, is not liable for, and is not a party to those transactions.
The terms of those transactions are determined solely by you and the
third-party with whom you are entering into said contract, and not by Yardi.
You acknowledge that you will address any issues or concerns with such
agreements with said third-parties directly, rather than Yardi. Yardi shall not
be involved in any issues relating to such agreements except where the issue is
solely attributable to a malfunction or error occurring on the Site or in
connection with the Services. If you choose to use the electronic signature
execution functionality of RENTCafé, you understand, acknowledge and agree that
you have carefully reviewed the disclosure relating to use of your electronic
signature to execute documents and will not execute such documents with your
electronic signature without providing your consent to use your electronic
signature. You agree that you will rely on your own legal counsel to determine
the sufficiency of the electronic signature execution of the documents and
their enforceability and that Yardi makes no warranty or other representation
with respect to the sufficiency of the electronic signature execution of the
documents under applicable international, national, federal, state, provincial
or local laws or regulations.

Yardi has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Site or the

GENERAL.
20.1            Governing
Law.  For all legal proceedings arising out of use of the Site and/or
relating to the Terms, these Terms and the relationship between you and Yardi
shall, irrespective of any choice of laws rules, be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of California. You and Yardi hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of courts located in
the County of Santa Barbara (California) or the court of competent jurisdiction
closest thereto if no court of competent jurisdiction resides therein, and the
parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and expressly waive
any right they may otherwise have to cause any such action or proceeding to be
brought or tried elsewhere. You and Yardi irrevocably waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that you may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any proceeding brought in any such court or any
claim that a legal proceeding commenced in such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.
20.2            Assignment.  You
may not assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the
prior written consent of Yardi, which may be granted or withheld by Yardi in
its sole discretion. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section will
be null and void and of no force or effect. Yardi may assign this Agreement
freely at any time without notice. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
will bind and inure to the benefit of each partys permitted successors and
assigns.
20.3            Waiver.  The
failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision shall not affect Yardis
right to exercise or enforce such right or provision at any time thereafter,
nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms constitute a waiver
of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
20.4            Severability.  If
any portion of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in such
provision, and, notwithstanding such finding, the remaining provisions of these
Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
20.5            Entire
Agreement.  These Terms, the terms incorporated herein, and any other
terms agreed to in writing by the parties or by way of your use of the Site or
the Services shall constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
agreement between you and Yardi regarding this subject matter, and shall
supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous representations or
understandings relating to this subject matter.
20.6            Time Limitation.  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Terms or use of the Site must be filed within 1 year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
