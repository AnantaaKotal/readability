Travel Services.

3.6.2. TripActions is not responsible for the provision of Travel Services and does not guarantee the correctness of any material, information or results made available to Customer by or from Travel Service Providers, and the presentation of travel inventory through the Subscription Services does not constitute a binding contract offer by TripActions or the respective Travel Service Provider. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase of Travel Services may be subject to the terms and conditions, agreements (such as contract of carriage), and privacy and security policies of the specific Travel Service Provider selected by the Authorized User, and (ii) the use of Travel Services will be subject to Customers and Authorized Users compliance with applicable law.

(iii)  Eligible Savings  means the difference between the Price to Beat and the total actual purchase price of the Reward-Eligible Booking, where the purchase price is less than the Price to Beat. (iv)  Reward Points  means a percentage of the Eligible Savings (which percentage is determined by the Algorithm), which is allocated to, and may be redeemed by, the Authorized User as a personal reward via the TripActions Reward Program. Reward Points accrue to the Authorized User upon the Authorized Users completion of travel for the Reward-Eligible Booking. (v)  Reward Program Funds  means the aggregate accrued Reward Points for all Authorized Users.

Confidentiality Obligations . During the Term and for a period of five (5) years after expiration or termination of this Agreement, neither party shall make the others Confidential Information available to any third party or use the others Confidential Information for any purposes other than exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement. Neither party shall disclose Confidential Information except to such partys advisors, accountants, attorneys, investors (and prospective investors), and prospective acquirers that have a reasonable need to know such information, provided that any such third parties shall, before they may access such information, either (a) execute a binding agreement to keep such information confidential or (b) be subject to a professional obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Each party shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the others Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of the terms of this Agreement, but in no event will either party use less effort to protect the Confidential Information of the other party than it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like importance. Each party will ensure that any agents or subcontractors that are permitted to access any of the others Confidential Information are legally bound to comply with the obligations set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed as required by any governmental agency, provided that before disclosing such information the disclosing party must provide (to the extent permitted by applicable law) the non-disclosing party with sufficient advance notice of the agencys request for the information to enable the non-disclosing party to exercise any rights it may have to challenge or limit the agencys authority to receive such Confidential Information.
7.2.
Security Obligations .

TripActions expressly reserves the right to correct any pricing errors on the Subscription Services and/or pending reservations made under an incorrect price.
8.4.
Algorithm . The Subscription Services make use of certain proprietary algorithms (collectively, the Algorithm) that take into account factors such as Customer policy, Authorized User profiles and behavior, current market conditions, and other relevant factors to determine dynamic travel policy limits, market price, Price to Beat, Rewards availability and amounts, sorting of Travel Services results, availability of special products and discounts, or other features. The Algorithm does not determine or affect the price of any Travel Services. Customer acknowledges that the Algorithm is a dynamic feature of the Subscription Services and may display different results in connection with different Authorized Users, locations, travel dates, and other search and profile elements.
8.5.
Travel Risk . By offering reservations for Travel Services via the Subscription Services, in particular for international destinations, TripActions does not represent or warrant that travel to such areas is advisable or without risk, and is not liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to such destinations.

TripActions further disclaims any and all warranties arising from course of dealing or usage of trade. No advice or information, including but not limited to tax advice and reporting responsibilities, whether oral or written, obtained from TripActions or elsewhere shall create any warranty not expressly stated in this Agreement. In jurisdictions that by law do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties in certain circumstances, the disclaimers in this Section 8.6 and elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to comply with such applicable law.
9. TERM AND TERMINATION
9.1.
Term . The term of the Subscription Services shall be as set forth in the applicable Service Order (Term). This Agreement shall commence on the date set forth in the Service Order (or, if no Service Order is in place, then on the date Customer commences using the Subscription Services), and shall continue until such time as Customer cancels the Employer Account, unless terminated earlier as provided in this Agreement. Commencement of the Subscription Services shall be determined by the Parties and included in the applicable Service Order. Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Service Order, the Term shall automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Term unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the expiring Term.
9.2.
Termination for Convenience . At any time, Customer may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately, by cancelling their Employer Account. Customer may, in its sole discretion, elect to offer TripActions advance notice of any such termination, and if so, TripActions will reasonably cooperate with Customer, in a wind-down of services prior to such termination. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Service Order, Customer shall not be entitled to a refund of any prepaid Fees as a result of Customers termination for convenience. In no event shall any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any undisputed Fees payable to TripActions for the period prior to the effective date of termination or cancellation.
9.3.
Termination for Breach . If either Party commits a material breach of its obligations in this Agreement or any Service Order (including payment obligations), the non-defaulting Party may give written notice to the defaulting Party specifying the nature of the default, and if such default is not remedied, or substantial efforts are not made to remedy such default, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice, then the non-defaulting Party shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement or the Service Order by written notice. If the breach relates solely to one Service Order, then only such Service Order may be terminated in accordance with the terms herein and the other Service Orders and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that Customer terminates due to breach by TripActions, Customer shall be entitled to a pro-rated refund of unused, prepaid Fees as of the date of termination.

Customers obligations under this Section 10.1 are contingent upon TripActions providing Customer with prompt written notice of such claim. TripActions may not settle any claim to which it is seeking or is entitled to indemnification in a manner that would result in an admission of any wrongdoing by Customer, without Customers prior written approval.
10.2
Indemnification by TripActions . TripActions shall indemnify Customer, its officers, directors, and employees, from and against any liabilities, losses, damages and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees, associated with any third partys claim that: (i) the Subscription Services or Customers authorized use of Subscription Services infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; or (ii) arises out of TripActions violation of applicable law. TripActions obligations under this Section 10.2 are contingent upon: (a) Customer providing TripActions with prompt written notice of such claim; (b) Customer providing reasonable cooperation to TripActions, at TripActions expense, in the defense and settlement of such claim; and (c) TripActions having sole authority to defend or settle such claim. With respect to claims described in subsection (i) herein, in the event that TripActions right to provide the Subscription Services is enjoined or in TripActions reasonable opinion is likely to be enjoined, TripActions may obtain the right to continue providing the Subscription Services, replace or modify the Subscription Services so that they become non-infringing, or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, terminate this Agreement without liability to Customer and provide a pro rata refund of any Fees prepaid and unused upon such termination. The foregoing states the entire obligation of TripActions and its licensors with respect to any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights by the Subscription Services. TripActions shall have no liability under this Section 10.2 to the extent that any claims described herein are based on use of the Subscription Services in a manner that violates this Agreement or the instructions given to Customer by TripActions.
