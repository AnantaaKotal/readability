Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties 4.1 EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN, TOAST AND ITS THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT AND QUALITY. TOAST AND ITS THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, SUITABILITY, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SERVICES OR THE RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE SERVICES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, TOAST AND ITS THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT (A) THE OPERATION OR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; OR (B) THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER TOAST NOR ITS THIRD- PARTY PROVIDERS CONTROL THE TRANSFER OF DATA OVER COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET, AND THAT THE SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF SUCH COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. TOAST IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES, OR OTHER DAMAGE RESULTING FROM SUCH PROBLEMS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TOAST DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT ANY OR ALL SECURITY ATTACKS WILL BE DISCOVERED, REPORTED OR REMEDIED, OR THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY SECURITY BREACHES BY THIRD PARTIES. EXCEPT WHERE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE BY TOAST, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO MERCHANT ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. 4.2 IN NO EVENT WILL TOAST BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE TH. E SERVICES, EVEN IF TOAST HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN HAS FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TOASTS AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). 4.3 Some states do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. IN SUCH STATES, THE LIABILITY OF THE TOAST PARTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 5. Indemnification .   You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Toast and its directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents from and against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from your breach of these Terms of Service or your access to, use or misuse of the Third-Party Content or Services. Toast will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Toast reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this Section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Toasts defense of such matter. 6. Termination of the Agreement 6.1 Toast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate these Terms of Service and your access to all or any part of the Services or User Content at any time and for any reason without prior notice or liability. Toast reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any part of the Services at any time without prior notice or liability. 6.2Sections 1 (Use of the Platform), 4 (Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties), 5 (Indemnification), 6 (Termination of Agreement) and 9 (Miscellaneous) will survive the termination of these Terms of Service. 7. Arbitration 7.1 Agreement to Arbitrate. This Section 7 is referred to as the Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Toast, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or in connection with your use of the Services, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, you and Toast are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement shall not preclude either party from pursuing a court action for the sole purpose of obtaining a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction in circumstances in which such relief is appropriate, provided that any other relief shall be pursued through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. 7.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief. You and Toast agree that each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and Toast agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one persons or partys claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that partys individual claim(s). 7.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Toast is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most participant concerns can be resolved quickly and to the participants satisfaction by emailing Toasts Customer Care team at support@toasttab.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (Notice). The Notice to Toast should be sent to Toast at 401 Park Drive, Suite 801, Boston, MA 02215, Attn: General Counsel. (Notice Address). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and Toast do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Toast may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Toast or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Toast is entitled. 7.4 Arbitration Procedures. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations (AAA) rules and procedures, including the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively, the AAA Rules), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless you and Toast agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Toast agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. 7.5 Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the Arbitration Fees) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. Any payment of attorneys fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. 7.6 Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties. 7.7 Severability. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than Sub-Section 7.2 above is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of Sub-Section 7.2 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply. 8. Compliance with Laws 8.1 You agree to comply with all federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and Merchants business in relation to your use of the Services, including any applicable tax laws and regulations, the then-current version of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards as made available at
https://www.pcisecuritystandar.
and the by-laws, and any and all other rules, policies and procedures of VISA, MasterCard, Discover and/or other card networks as in effect from time to time. 8.2 The United States controls the export of products and information. You expressly agree to comply with such restrictions and not to export or re-export any part of the Services to countries or persons prohibited under the export control laws. By accessing, using or downloading the Services, you are expressly agreeing that you are not in a country where such export is prohibited or are a person or entity for which such export is prohibited. You are solely responsible for compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction regarding the import, export or re-export of the Services. 9. Miscellaneous
Any action, claim, or dispute related to these Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, and controlling U.S. federal law. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to these Terms of Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which will remain in full force and effect. Failure of Toast to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms of Service will not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision herein. No waiver will be effective against Toast unless made in writing, and no such waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by Toast and you, these Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Toast with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between you and Toast with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and will not be given any legal import. These Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of our successors and assigns. You may not assign these Terms of Service without our prior written consent. Any information submitted or provided by you to the Services might be publicly accessible. Important and private information should be protected by you. 10. Google-Enabled Software Applications As part of the Services, Toast may offer mobile applications that are intended to be operated in connection with products made commercially available by third parties that operate using the Android operating system, which is owned by Google Inc. (Google, and such software, Google Software). With respect to the Google Software, in addition to the other terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Service, the following terms and conditions apply: 10.1 Toast and you acknowledge that these Terms of Service are entered into between Toast and you only, and not with Google, and that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, as between Toast and Google, Toast, not Google, is solely responsible for Google Software and the content thereof. 10.2 You may not use Google Software in any manner that is in violation of or inconsistent with the usage rules set forth for Google Software in, or otherwise be in conflict with, the then-current Google terms of service available at:
https://play.google.com/intl/e.
(the App Store Terms of Service). 10.3 Your license to use Google Software is limited to a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Google Software on a supported Android-based device that you own, or otherwise have rights to use, and that meets the applicable system and compatibility requirements, all as set forth by the usage requirements set forth in the App Store Terms of Service. 10.4 Google has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services with respect to Google Software. 10.5 Google is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law. 10.6 Toast and you acknowledge that Toast, not Google, is responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to Google Software or your possession and/or use of that Google Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that Google Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. 10.7 In the event of any third party claim that Google Software or the end-users possession and use of that Google Software infringes that third partys intellectual property rights, as between Toast and Google, Toast, not Google, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim. 10.8 You represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist supporting country; and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. 10.9 If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to Google Software, they should be directed to Toast. 10.10 The Google Play marketplace is owned and operated by Google. Your use of Google Play is governed by a legal agreement between you and Google consisting of the Google Terms of Service (found at http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS) and the Google Play Terms of Service (found at https://play.google.com/intl/en-US_us/about/play-terms.html). In addition, your use of Google Play is subject to the Google Play Business and Program Policies. The Google Play Market Terms of Service, Google Play Business and Program Policies, and Google Terms of Service will take precedence in that order in the event of a conflict between them, to the extent of such conflict. Toast Diner Terms of Service Effective: February 10, 2020 The following Terms of Service (Terms) are a legal agreement between you and Toast, Inc.

Toast provides technology services that enable Restaurants to offer loyalty and/or rewards programs to Diners. By enrolling in any loyalty program offered by Toast or by a Restaurant using Toasts technology services, you expressly agree to these program terms. You may enroll in a Restaurants loyalty program by signing up at the Restaurant or while placing an order. Once you have enrolled, you may earn points when you make Purchases from Restaurants, which can later be redeemed for discounts or other benefits. If you initiate a return, chargeback, or refund, points associated with the Purchase may be revoked. You may check your current rewards balance by clicking the link you receive when you sign up for a Restaurants loyalty program. If you choose to enroll in a Restaurants loyalty program, you agree that the Restaurant may contact you using the contact method(s) you provide with program information, offers, and other marketing and transactional communications. Toast does not authorize Restaurants to send marketing messages to your mobile number. Restaurants may not send marketing messages to your mobile number unless you expressly authorize the Restaurant to send you such messages. Each Restaurant is solely responsible for the operation and maintenance of its own loyalty program, including establishing the number of points that you may earn when you make Purchases, setting redemption thresholds, and determining how and when points may be redeemed for rewards. Restaurants have the ability to modify their loyalty programs and/or to modify the points balance held by any individual Diner. Toast is not responsible for notifying you in the event that the Restaurant changes any element of its loyalty program or ceases to offer a loyalty program. The Restaurant is solely responsible for communicating program or points balance changes to you. Points earned through any loyalty program offered by Toast or a Restaurant using Toast technology services have no cash value and cannot be transferred, redeemed, or sold for cash. Toast reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at any time, to modify, suspend, terminate, revalue or cancel its own loyalty program and/or the technology services that enable Restaurants to offer loyalty programs through Toast. Toast reserves the right to adjudicate any discrepancies or disputes regarding rewards allocations or these program terms in its sole discretion and you agree to abide by any such adjudication. 1.5 Restaurant Responsibilities Each Restaurant is solely responsible for all aspects of its own day-to-day operations, including provision of food and beverages (by any method, including through delivery), service, environment, and overall quality and accuracy. 1.5.1 Compliance.

Certain Restaurants may hold alcoholic beverage licenses and sell alcoholic beverage products. The Restaurant holding the alcoholic beverage license must approve your Purchase before the Purchase will be finalized, and only upon acceptance of the order by the Restaurant will your Payment Method be charged. The portion of the funds charged to your Payment Method which pertains to your alcoholic beverage product Purchase will be held in an account for the benefit of the alcoholic beverage supplier in compliance with Applicable Law.

In certain cases, we may not allow you to close your account, including but not limited to: to evade an investigation; you have open or pending Purchases or Payment Transactions; or if you owe money to Toast or a Restaurant due to your use of the Services. 2. Data Privacy and Security The privacy and security of your personal information is important to us. Toasts Privacy Statement describes what information we collect about you and how we may use personal information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Statement carefully, as it forms a binding part of these Terms of Service and contains important information about your rights. 3. Purchases Toast makes available the Services and processes Payment Transactions for Purchases on behalf of Restaurants as the agent of the Restaurants through the payment networks. When you make a Purchase, you authorize Toast, as agent for the Restaurant, to submit the charge in the amount of the Purchase (including any gratuities, fees and taxes) to your Payment Method as well as any credits in connection with chargebacks, reversals, refunds or adjustments. Toast, as the agent of the Restaurant, will assist the Restaurant in submitting the Payment Transaction to the payment network and processing the Payment Transaction. Upon Toast receiving the proceeds of the transaction, your payment obligation to the Restaurant will be deemed completed (except in the case of a later chargeback or reversal). You must provide a valid Payment Method to pay for your Purchases made through any of the Services. You authorize Toast to confirm your Payment Method is in good standing with the issuing financial institution. In order to do so, Toast may obtain an authorization to charge your Payment Method for a Payment Transaction. This authorization may reduce your available funds balance by the authorization amount until the Payment Transaction is actually charged to your Payment Method and the proceeds are processed and settled. Please contact your Payment Method issuer if you have questions regarding the status of an authorization or of a charge to your Payment Method. You agree that Toast, on behalf of the Restaurant, may resubmit a Payment Transaction for processing to a payment network in the event a prior Payment Transaction was declined or returned. If you choose to store Payment Method information with Toast via any of the Services for your convenience and use in future transactions, you agree that Toast may receive up-to-date information on your Payment Method information (such as card number or expiration date) through services available from the card networks and may update your Payment Method credentials stored with Toast (if you choose to store your Payment Method credentials) from time to time. We may establish limitations concerning use of the Services, including without limitation individual or aggregate transaction limits on the dollar amount or number of Payment Transactions you may make within certain time periods. We may decline to process any Payment Transaction without any notice to you. We may delay processing of or hold or cancel processing of any Payment Transaction upon the direction of the Restaurant or if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the transaction is invalid, suspicious, involves misconduct or fraud, or otherwise violates Applicable Law, these Terms of Service, or any other Policies. Payments made through the Services are also subject to the terms of your agreement with your Payment Method issuer. You are solely responsible for any charges or fees that may be imposed by your Payment Method issuer as a result of using the Services. 4.

By making a Purchase through the Services, you agree to pay all such charges, including gratuities, fees and taxes. All amounts to be charged to your Payment Method associated with your Purchase will be displayed to you before you complete your Purchase. 6. Order Changes, Cancellation, Refunds and Customer Service Restaurants each set their own cancellation and refund policies. Once a Purchase has been made through Toast app or Online Ordering, you will need to contact the Restaurant directly to inquire if you can make a change to or cancel the Purchase or whether you may receive a refund.

You further agree that your electronic signature on these Terms and any other document shall have the same legal effect under state and federal law as if you signed the documents in ink on paper. 14. Arbitration 14.1. Agreement to Arbitrate This Section 14 is referred to as the Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Toast, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or in connection with your use of the Services, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, you and Toast are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement shall not preclude either party from pursuing a court action for the sole purpose of obtaining a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction in circumstances in which such relief is appropriate, provided that any other relief shall be pursued through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. 14.2. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief You and Toast agree that each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and Toast agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one persons or partys claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that partys individual claim(s). 14.3. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution Most concerns can be resolved quickly and to all parties satisfaction by emailing Toasts Customer Care team at support@toasttab.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (Notice). The Notice to Toast should be sent to Toast at 401 Park Drive, Suite 801, Boston, MA 02215, Attn: General Counsel. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and Toast do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Toast may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Toast or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Toast is entitled. 14.4. Arbitration Procedures Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations (AAA) rules and procedures, including the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively, the AAA Rules), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and Applicable Law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless you and Toast agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by the AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Toast agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. 14.5. Costs of Arbitration Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. Any payment of attorneys fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. 14.6. Confidentiality All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties. 14.7. Severability If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than Sub-Section 15.1 above is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of Sub-Section 15.1 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply. 15. Survival Upon termination of your use of the Service or these Terms of Service for any reason, in addition to this section, the following sections shall survive termination: Section 1.7 (Restaurant Responsibilities), 5 (Fees), 8 (Disclaimer of Warranties, Waiver and Limitation of Liability), 10 (Indemnification), 11 (Ownership of Content, Use of Trademarks), 12 (Termination), 14 (Arbitration), 17 (Governing Law), and 18 (Miscellaneous). 16. Assignment You may not assign these Terms of Service or any rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent and any attempted assignment may be void. We reserve the right to freely assign these Terms of Service and the rights and obligations hereunder, to any third party without notice and consent. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Service shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their successors and permitted assigns. 17. Governing Law Any action, claim, or dispute related to these Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, and controlling U.S. federal law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to these Terms of Service. 18. Miscellaneous If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which will remain in full force and effect. Failure of Toast to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms of Service will not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision herein.
