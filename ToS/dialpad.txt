Dialpad Terms of Service
Welcome to Dialpad. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s),
products, services and applications, which include, but are not limited to, UberConference, Dialpad Talk,
Dialpad Support, and Dialpad Sell (the Services) that you order directly through our website. For the
avoidance of doubt, if you order services through a Master Service Agreement with us, any such services are
governed by the terms of the Master Service Agreement and not these online terms. If you have any questions,
comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at support@dialpad.com or write
us at 100 California Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA 94111.
These Terms of Service (the Terms) are a binding contract between you and Dialpad, Inc. (Dialpad, we and
us). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you dont have the right to use the Services. Your use
of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect
while you use the Services. Your use of the Services and our website constitutes your agreement with and to be
bound by all terms and conditions included in these Terms as well as the terms outlined in the Acceptable Use
Policy, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Dispute Policy, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We
reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a
notice on the Dialpad website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. If you dont agree with the
new Terms, you are free to reject them by discontinuing your use of the Services; unfortunately, that means you
will no longer be able to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is
effective and serves as your acceptance of and agreement with any such changes.

unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

Billing and Payment
Some of the Dialpad Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services
in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are currently using begin carrying a fee, and if you
wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.
If you choose to sign up for any Services that carry a fee (the Paid Services) you will be charged the then
current fees for such Paid Services. Dialpads current fees for the Paid Services can be found at
https://www.dialpad.com/pricing
and
https://www.uberconference.com/pricing . Unless otherwise agreed, all fees paid to Dialpad are non-refundable.
Unless you are paying for the service pursuant to an invoicing arrangement with Dialpad or one of our authorized
resellers (Reseller), as described in the following paragraphs, any applicable initiation charges, usage,
monthly recurring charges, support charges, and other fees are billed in full in advance. Termination,
international calling, equipment return fees and transfer charges, if any, are billed in arrears. Upon
termination of your Account for any reason, all unused calling credits and international calling credits shall
expire in their entirety on the termination date. No refund, transfer or proration shall be made of any unused
calling credits, additional credits, promotional credits, or international calling credits or of any remaining
periods/months on any account.
When you subscribe to Services, you will provide us with a payment method, such as a valid credit card (including
proper billing information), and, if applicable, authorize us to collect from your payment method. Any
authorization will remain valid until thirty (30) days after you terminate our authority to charge your payment
method. Upon termination, we will charge you any fees and any other outstanding charges and disconnect your
Service. You agree to advise and notify us of any changes to your payment method, such as credit card account
number or expiration date changes. If the credit card or other payment method on your Account is declined or
fails for any reason, Dialpad will use reasonable efforts to contact you and advise you of the failed billing
attempts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dialpad reserves the right to disconnect your Service and terminate
your account if your credit card on file is declined or fails for any reason, and Dialpad reserves the right to
continue to attempt charging your credit card for any outstanding Service charges and additional fees and pursue
any other legal remedies available to Dialpad.
Time is of the essence for payment. Therefore, you agree to pay us interest at the lesser rate of (a) 18% per
annum or (b) the highest rate allowed by law for any amounts unpaid as of the due date. Acceptance of late or
partial payments (even if marked Paid in Full) shall not waive any of Dialpads rights to collect the full
amount due. We may assess an additional fee of the lesser of (a) fifty dollars ($50) or (b) the highest amount
allowed by law for any credit card chargeback or check returned for nonpayment.
Billing cycle end dates may change from time to time. When a billing cycle covers less than or more than a full
month, we may make reasonable adjustments and prorate the charges to your account.
You must dispute any charges for the Services in writing to Dialpad within thirty (30) days of the date of the
charge by Dialpad. If you fail to provide a written statement explaining in reasonable detail your reasons for
disputing the charge within such time period, you hereby irrevocably waive any objection and further recourse
with regard to such charges. Written statements disputing charges must be sent to support@dialpad.com.
Product Pricing and Availability
With respect to its advertising, offering, or sale of applications, Services, or any other products
(collectively, Service(s)), Dialpad attempts to describe its products as accurately as possible. Nevertheless,
Dialpad does not warrant that any descriptions, pricing, availability, or other information relating to the
advertising, offering, or sale of Services (collectively, Service Information) from its website, marketing
materials, promotional flyers, advertisements, or other printed or electronic materials (collectively, Service
Materials) is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Despite our efforts, it is possible that
Service Information may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or that the Services may be unavailable. In the
event Dialpad determines that a Service is mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, Dialpad reserves
the right to take any action it deems reasonable and necessary to rectify the error, including without
limitation, canceling your account or subscription to the Services. You agree to notify Dialpad immediately if
you become aware of any pricing or descriptive errors or inconsistencies with any Services you order through the
Service Materials and comply with any corrective action taken by Dialpad. You acknowledge and agree that the

provided on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of Dialpad and shall be your sole remedy for any Service
interruptions or other issues with the Services.

which are chargeable to or recoverable from customers by any federal, state, local, or international law or
regulation, as well as any administrative and recovery fees and charges levied on the Services by Dialpad,
whether or not mandated by law or regulation. Should Dialpad pay or be required to pay such liabilities

indebtedness to Dialpad.

distance, international, additional feature charges, 411 and operator assisted charges, and directory assistance
charges, and for all taxes, surcharges, and fees imposed on you or us as a result of your use of the Service.
Discounts

codes must be provided to Dialpad upon purchase of the Services. You shall not be entitled to a subsequent
credit for such promotions or discounts if you do not request such credit at the time of account creation or
change of service. Promotions and/or discounts may not be used cumulatively or be used for Services
retroactively. If a promotion and/or discount is offered on a confidential basis, you agree not to disclose the
promotion and/or discount and to assume full responsibility for any harm, direct or indirect, caused to Dialpad
by the disclosure of the promotion and/or discount.
Unlimited Calling
Dialpad offers unlimited monthly calling for domestic calls (United States and Canada) and text messages from
your mobile phone or computer. An unlimited service provides you with a domestic telephone number and is subject
to the terms and restrictions of the Acceptable Use Policy along with any other restrictions described herein,
as well as any reseller agreements, if applicable. If, for any reason, Dialpad believes that you are using the
unlimited service for a prohibited purpose and/or your call usage violates the Acceptable Use Policy, then
Dialpad may, in its sole discretion with or without notice, terminate your unlimited service.
Toll-Free Calling
Dialpad offers toll-free numbers, for an additional monthly fee, plus additional charges based on the minutes of
use for inbound calls. Having a toll-free number requires that you maintain a balance of calling credits. When
you are nearing exhaustion of your initial paid allotment of calling credits, we will automatically recharge on
your behalf, an incremental package for additional credits, unless you disable this feature otherwise. Post-paid
pricing packages and other variable terms may be available through invoiced accounts or resellers. Please refer
to any applicable reseller agreements for additional terms of service. If, for any reason, Dialpad believes that
you are using the toll-free calling for a prohibited purpose and/or your call usage violates the Acceptable Use
Policy, then Dialpad may, in its sole discretion with or without notice, terminate your toll-free calling
service.
International Calling and "Local" International Telephone Numbers
To make international calls using the Services, you must enable international calling in your settings and
pre-purchase at least the minimum package of international calling credits necessary to make such international
calls. Insufficient credits may cause your call to be terminated. Packages of international calling credits will
decrement based on the rate defined per country and carrier. Our international calling rates are available at
https://www.dialpad.com/rates/
. In addition, you may be charged
any applicable Taxes and Fees associated with international calls. You are solely responsible for the region and
numbers you choose and any associated charges on your account. Dialpad also offers some local international
numbers for you to make and receive calls and texts. Rates, terms, Taxes and Fees associated with international
inbound and outbound calling and texting services may vary based on the country and reseller agreement, if
applicable. If, for any reason, Dialpad believes that You are using the Service for a prohibited purpose and/or
your call usage violates the Acceptable Use Policy, then Dialpad may, in its sole discretion with or without
notice, terminate your service.
Value, Ownership, and Expiration of Calling Credits
Toll-free and international calling credits have no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for the cash value or
refunded at any time after such credits are purchased by you, including after the closure of your account.
Credits may only be redeemed and used by the holder or users of the associated account or office to which the
Credits have been credited, and may not be sold, transferred, assigned, or used by another user or with another
users account or office. Any unused credits remain on your account and "roll over" to the next billing period.
Additional credits and promotional credits expire according to the terms of their purchase.

Services with Dialpad. If no legal entity is provided upon sign-up, the account owner shall be the owner of the
credit card used to open the account. Subsequent changes to ownership must be supported by appropriate legal
documentation. Dialpad shall not adjudicate ownership-related disputes, or any other internal business dispute.
If Dialpad is unable to determine the valid owner of the account, Dialpad reserves the right to suspend or
terminate the account and Services.

U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
Recording Conversations
Certain Dialpad Services provide a function that allows you to record individual telephone conversations. The
laws regarding the notice, notification, and consent requirements for recording conversations vary from state to

Note that the laws applicable to call transcription differ by state, province and country. For some
jurisdictions, transcribing recorded calls, recording calls, or even transcribing real-time speech over a call

fully-paid up, royalty free license to use all feedback, answers, ideas, comments, or other information you

Number Porting and Availability
Dialpad will use reasonable efforts to facilitate number transfers or port requests for you, provided that You
comply with the necessary and specific procedures for porting between service providers. You acknowledge and
understand that number porting depends on the cooperation of third parties outside of Dialpads control.
Accordingly, you agree that Dialpad will not be liable for the failure or delay of any third party to cooperate
in the porting of any telephone number, or for the allegedly unauthorized porting of any telephone number by a
third party.
Dialpad works with third party carrier(s) who, on Dialpads behalf, port telephone numbers in accordance with
applicable regulatory rules and industry guidelines. Dialpads third-party carrier(s) require very specific and
detailed information and requirements when completing a port request. Please be informed that you will be
required to provide such detailed and specific information to complete a port request. For porting numbers into
your Dialpad account, follow the procedures on your account settings page for transferring a number to your
Dialpad account. For porting numbers out of your Dialpad account, follow the procedures of your new service
provider. You understand that porting your number out of your Account does not automatically terminate your
Dialpad account.
Dialpad cannot guarantee requested telephone numbers will be available, that your existing provider will port
your number, or that circumstances beyond Dialpads control will not prevent or delay a successful port of your
number for the Services. You should not order any printed material, such as business cards or stationery,
showing a telephone number, or issue any press releases or otherwise publicize any telephone number until that
telephone number becomes active on your Account. Dialpad shall not be liable for reimbursement for press
releases, business cards, and/or stationery under any conditions.
You understand and agree that Dialpad may from time to time need to change the telephone number or assigned to
you (due to an area code split or for any other reason). Dialpad shall not be liable for any damages (including
consequential, special damages or other damages) to you in the event that it needs to assign you a new telephone
number.
Dialpad 911 Service
FOR USERS OF DIALPAD FREE, ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES (911) IS NOT AVAILABLE. BY USING DIALPAD FREE SERVICES,
INCLUDING PORTING YOUR EXISTING NUMBERS TO DIALPAD FREE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS TO REACH 911 AND THAT YOU WILL INFORM ALL BUSINESS COLLEAGUES, HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTS, GUESTS, AND
OTHER PERSONS WHO MAY BE PRESENT AT YOUR PHYSICAL LOCATION THAT 911 IS UNAVAILABLE THROUGH DIALPAD FREE.
FOR SUBSCRIBERS OF DIALPAD PAID SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 911 SERVICE IS ONLY PROVIDED THROUGH THE DIALPAD
DESKTOP APP OR THE DIALPAD SOFTPHONE DUE TO THE NATURE OF DIALPAD 911 SERVICE AND SERVICE PORTABILITY DISCUSSED
BELOW, WE RECOMMEND YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO PLACE 911 CALLS, SUCH AS USING A TRADITIONAL WIRELINE
OR CELLULAR TELEPHONE, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON DIALPAD TO CALL 911.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIALPAD MOBILE APPLICATION USES YOUR DEVICES DIALER AND CELLULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE TO
MAKE 911 CALLS. IF YOUR DEVICE DOES NOT HAVE CELLULAR TELEPHONE SERVICE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CALL 911 FROM
THE DIALPAD MOBILE APPLICATION. DIALPAD DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO YOUR (OR ANY OF YOUR USERS
OR THIRD PARTIES) INABILITY TO MAKE 911 CALLS OR ACCESS EMERGENCY SERVICES.
Dialpad VoIP 911 Service (Dialpad 911 Service) operates differently than traditional 911 service. We are
required by the FCC to advise you of the circumstances under which 911 may not be available or may be in some
way limited by comparison to traditional 911 service. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to,
Internet Connection Failure, Number Flexibility & Porting, and Loss of Electrical Power (as described below):
Internet connection failure.
If the connection to the wired broadband internet over which your
Dialpad Service is provided is interrupted, you would not have access to Dialpad Service during that
interruption and therefore will not have access to Dialpad 911 Service during that interruption.
Number Flexibility & Service Portability.
Traditional 911 service automatically sends your 911 call
to the appropriate local emergency responder, or Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), based on your
telephone number. Traditional Enhanced 911 service (also known as E911) automatically sends your 911 call to
the appropriate PSAP along with your registered address and telephone number. Because the Dialpad Service
permits you to obtain a telephone number that does not correspond to your geographic location (for example,
you may obtain a Dialpad telephone number with a California area code even if you do not have a California
address) and allows you to use Dialpad Service anywhere you have wired broadband Internet, the Dialpad 911
Service functions differently than traditional 911 service in certain respects: Because your address does
not necessarily correspond with your telephone number, you must provide Dialpad with the street address(es)
where you will be using Dialpad Service (Registered Location(s)) when you sign up for Dialpad service. If
you relocate any equipment (e.g., PC with softphone, IP phone, or ATA with traditional phone) that you use
to access the Dialpad Service, you must update your Registered Location(s). If you do not update your
Registered Location(s), any 911 calls you make using the Dialpad Service will be routed based on your
previously provided Registered Location and therefore may not be routed to the appropriate PSAP for your new
location. In addition, because the Dialpad Service will, where possible, automatically transmit your
Registered Location to the PSAP, you must update your Registered Location to ensure that the Dialpad Service
transmits accurate location information to the PSAP. Once you notify us of a change in your Registered
Location, there may be a delay in making the new Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls
and advise PSAPs of your new Registered Location. In some parts of the country where direct routing to PSAPs
is not available for Dialpad 911 Service, the Service will route your call to the National Emergency Call
Center where trained agents will ask for the name, location, and telephone number of the person calling 911
and will contact the appropriate PSAP to send help. The call center will not automatically receive your
address and telephone number. In these situations, public safety response times may be delayed. As a result,
there may be an additional delay before emergency services arrive.
Loss of Electrical Power.
Unless you have a backup system to power your wired broadband Internet
connection and any equipment (PC with softphone, IP phone, ATA with traditional phone) that You use to
access your Dialpad Service, you will not have phone service or 911 service during any power outage.
Registration of Physical Locations Required.
As discussed above, you must register the Registered Location
where you will be using Dialpad Service for each phone line you use from Dialpad (e.g., if you purchase Dialpad
with three lines, you must provide a Registered Location for each of the three lines). Dialpad will obtain your
Registered Location as part of the service initiation process and will not provide Dialpad Service until you
have provided your initial Registered Location. However, you must update your Registered Location when you use
your Dialpad Service from a new location. Regardless of what address you register, in some circumstances, such
as unavailability of direct routing to PSAPs or the use of portable devices to access the Dialpad Service,
emergency calls will be routed to the National Emergency Call Center.
You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Registered Location information to Dialpad as part of
the service initiation process and to update as soon as possible your Registered Location with true, accurate,
current, and complete information whenever you use your Dialpad Service from a new location. If you provide
Registered Location information that is, or that Dialpad suspects to be, false, inaccurate, not current, or
incomplete, Dialpad has the right to suspend or terminate the Services and refuse any and all current or future
use of all Services, or any portion thereof. Dialpad will not, however, disable your ability to make a 911 call
during any service suspension.
You may update your Registered Location by logging on to your account settings page or contacting Dialpad
customer support at support@dialpad.com. For purposes of 911 dialing, you may only register one Registered
Location for each Dialpad line.
Notify All Users of 911 Limitations.
You must inform all business colleagues, household residents, guests,
and other persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the Dialpad Service that 911 may
not be available or may be in some way limited in comparison to traditional 911 service. For subscribers to whom
E911 service is provided as part of their Dialpad Services, stickers may be sent with warning that E911 Service
May Be Limited or Not Available for use with any equipment purchased from Dialpad. It is your responsibility to
place these stickers on the equipment you use to access Dialpad Service. If you have not received a sticker, or
you require additional 911 stickers, please contact customer support at support@dialpad.com.
Disclaimer of 911 Liability.
Dialpad disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of PSAPs, the National
Emergency Call Center, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services.
Dialpad does not have any control over PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, or other third parties and is
therefore not responsible for whether they answer 911 calls made using the Dialpad Service, how they answer
these calls, or how they handle or respond to these calls. Dialpad relies on third parties to assist it in the
provision of 911 service and disclaims any and all liability for acts or omissions by third parties in the
provision of Dialpads 911 service. Dialpad expressly disclaims all liability with respect to your use of the
E911 service. You hereby agree to fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, hold harmless, and fully
indemnify Dialpad from and against any damages or liabilities of any kind related to your use of the E911
services.
Operator Assisted Calling, 311, 511, and Other X11 Calling
The Service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling (including, without limitation, collect calls, third
party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls). The Service may not support 311, 411, 511, and/or other X11
calling (other than 911 and 711 as specified in this Agreement) in one or more service areas.
Fraudulent Activity or Erroneous Changes
In the event of suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on your Account, you agree to contact Dialpad
as soon as possible. In many cases, Dialpad can mitigate or correct fraudulent activity or erroneous charges
without bank or credit card company intervention. If you suspect fraudulent activity or erroneous charges on
your Dialpad account, please contact Dialpad customer support at support@dialpad.com. When you contact customer
support, please have the following information available: (a) your name, contact information, the Dialpad
account telephone number in question, and security verification information; (b) the credit card account number
associated with the account; and (c) the total amount in question charged to the account. If you do not contact
Dialpad within thirty (30) days after the suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous charges appear on your
Account, you waive your rights to object to or challenge such activity or charges. Furthermore, if you request
that your bank or credit card company perform a chargeback without first contacting Dialpad, and Dialpad
subsequently determines that the charges at issue are not erroneous, Dialpad reserves the right to terminate
your account immediately and take any available legal action. Notwithstanding the above, you are solely liable
for any transactions or activities by you or anyone else that occur on your Account, and in no event shall
Dialpad be liable for any unauthorized use of your Account.
AUP Breach
In the event that you breach any of the terms of this AUP, Dialpad retains the right to suspend or terminate
Customers use of the Dialpad Services (including UberConference) upon written notice to you. No credits will be
available for terminations or suspensions resulting from Customers breach of the AUP.

Copyright Dispute Policy
In accordance with the DMCA, weve adopted this Copyright Dispute Policy. We reserve the right to (1) block
access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally
copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and/or (2)
remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders. Your use of Dialpads Services is at all times subject to
the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Copyright Dispute Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without
defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.
Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements.
If you believe that material or content residing on or
accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to
act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to
Dialpads Designated Agent (contact details are listed below):
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright
that has been allegedly infringed;
Identification of works or materials being infringed;
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location
of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that
Dialpad is capable of finding and verifying its existence;
Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number, and email address;
A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the identified infringing material is not
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party
is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
Procedure Following Dialpads Receipt of Bona Fide Infringement Notification.
Upon receipt of a proper
notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:
Remove or disable access to the infringing material;
Notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the
applicable material; and
Terminate such content provider's access to the Services if a repeat offender or as otherwise deemed
appropriate in our sole discretion.
Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.
If the content provider believes that the
material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing (or otherwise has a bona fide
right to post and use such material from the copyright owner) the content provider may send our Designated Agent
a counter-notice containing the following information:
A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location
at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a
result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and
Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and email address; and
A statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial
district in which the content providers address is located (or if the content provider's address is located
outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Dialpad is located), and acknowledgement that
such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the
alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received by our Designated Agent, Dialpad may, in its discretion, send a copy of the
counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Dialpad may replace the removed
material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or
access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Dialpad's
discretion.
