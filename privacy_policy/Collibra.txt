Additionally, we may receive Information about you from other third parties whom you have authorized to share your Information or who collect your Information in connection with co-branded offerings.

Aggregated and de-identified Information.
We aggregate and de-identify your Personal Information so that the information no longer relates to you individually.

We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period.
When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.
How we transfer your Personal Information.
We transfer your Personal Information to countries other than the country where you are located, including to the United States or any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities. This includes transfers to:
countries for which adequacy decisions have been issued (which means any country recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection);
third parties covered by contractual protections (the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission); and
third parties based on our or their certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.
Privacy Shield Framework.
Commitment.
Collibra complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission (the Principles) regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information (as defined under the Privacy Shield Principles) transferred from the European Union and Switzerland, including the United Kingdom to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield.
Collibra has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such Information. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov/ .
Recourse, enforcement and liability.
If you have any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Principles, we encourage you to contact us as listed in the Contact us section below. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at:
legal@collibra.com .
We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit
JAMS Privacy Shield complaints
for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. Collibra is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Accountability for onward transfers of Personal Information.
If Collibra shares EU Personal Information with a third-party service provider that processes the Personal Information solely on Collibras behalf, then Collibra may be held liable for that third partys processing of EU Personal Information in violation of the Principles, unless Collibra can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
How we secure your Information.
We take appropriate security measures on both a technical and an organisational level, designed to keep your Personal Information secure. Our technical, administrative and physical procedures are designed to protect Personal Information from loss, theft, misuse and accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, use and destruction.
At the same time, you also share responsibility for maintaining the privacy and security of your Personal Information, for example: by not allowing any third party to use your personal account on the Services and avoiding all other non-authorised access to your login and access code.
We encourage you to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your personal account by sending an e-mail to
privacy@collibra.com .
Your rights.

In addition, you may request us to update and correct inaccuracies, delete your Personal Information, restrict processing of your Personal Information or exercise your right to data portability to easily transfer your Personal Information to another company. In some cases, you may object to the processing of your Personal Information and where we have asked you for your consent to process your Personal Information, you can withdraw it at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal. The above rights may be limited under applicable law.
