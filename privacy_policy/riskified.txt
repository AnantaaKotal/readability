Services Privacy Policy
Riskified provides online merchants (each, a Merchant) with services that help merchants optimize their e-commerce experience, including by preventing fraudulent online transactions, preventing account takeover, offering consumers an alternative payment method and increasing payment authorization (the Services). Merchants integrate our Services on their websites and mobile apps where consumers like you place orders (collectively, the Merchant Website). After you place an order, the Merchant Website may request that we process your personal data to provide our services.
This Privacy Policy (Policy) explains the privacy practices of Riskified Ltd., on behalf of ourselves and for the benefit of our affiliates (Riskified, we, our, or us) for our Services. It describes how we collect, use and share personal data, and the rights and options available to you with respect to your information.
You are not obligated by law to provide us with your personal data, but the Merchant Website may require that you provide us with your personal data to enable the processing of orders you place. Please note that this Policy does not cover the practices or policies of Merchants, the Merchant Website, or other parties.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
During the past 12 months we have collected the categories of information listed below, and anticipate that we will continue to collect such information. This information is collected directly from you, from Merchants, from our service providers, from publicly available sources and through the Merchant Website and is used by us to provide Services for our merchants, to improve those services and as otherwise described in Use of Collected Information below.
Transaction data.
When you place an order with a Merchant Website, we collect various data regarding your transaction, which may includeÂ  personal data, such as your name, email, address, the items you purchased, price paid, shipping information, and (if you have one) basic information from your account on the Merchant Website. We also collect basic information about your payment and billing method. We do not collect or keep your complete credit card number.
Device data.
We collect information about the personal computer or mobile device you use to access the Merchant Website. This includes the device model, operating system, unique identifiers, browser type, mobile network information, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you accessed the Merchant Website.
Geo-location data.
If you use the mobile app of a Merchant Website, we collect your geo-location when you are actively using the app. If you use the Merchant website, we collect your city-approximate geo-location.
Analytical data.
We collect analytical data about your use of the Merchant Website. For example, we collect the frequency of your access to the Merchant Website, the time you spend accessing the Merchant Website, when you scroll, as well as any events sent to a behavioral tracking service, the pages that referred you to the Merchant Website, as well as the pages and items on the Merchant Website that you viewed or interacted with.
Cross-references.
We also cross-reference, verify, and enhance the accuracy of the data outlined above using third-party online sources such as search engines, social networks, white pages, and mapping services. If you have provided the Merchant with access to information of third-party platforms, (including social networks), we may also receive the same access permissions to the information that you made public.
Inquiries.
If you contact us for questions or complaints, we will collect the information related to your inquiry and to verify your identity. This may include your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and other contact information, depending on the nature of your inquiry.
USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION
When a Merchant asks us to review an order you place on a Merchant Website, we review the data of your activities across all the Merchant Websites of our Merchants as well as any other data collected. We use this data to provide the Merchant a fraud analysis indicating whether or not the order is, in our assessment, a fraudulent online transaction. It is then at the discretion of the Merchant (not Riskified) to accept or decline your order.
We also use the information we collect for the following purposes:
Improving and enhancing Services and developing new services;
Statistical analysis of consumers activities;
Handling your requests and complaints;
Enforcing this Policy and preventing misuse of the Services;
Taking any action in any case of disputes involving you, in relation to the Services; and,
Any other action that may be mandated by law or undertaken to protect our legal rights and property and/or those of third parties.
SHARING INFORMATION COLLECTED
We may share the information outlined in this Policy with others, in the following instances:
With our third-party service providers
We use service providers to assist us in providing the Services. We only share with them the limited elements of the personal data we collect which are strictly necessary for them to provide us with their service. These service providers include data sources, such as white pages, data providers, and mapping services and other similar services. We do this in order to cross-reference, verify, and enhance the accuracy of the data that we collect. Some of these service providers may use the data we share with them for their own permitted purposes, in accordance with their own terms and policies subject to applicable law, such as
Googles Privacy Policy
and
Terms of Service .
With Merchants
We may share limited elements of your personal data with Merchants with whom you made your transactions. This information sharing will be for the purpose of reviews, audits or dispute handling or responding to your request for access to your personal data.
With Our Partners
Riskified partners with certain entities, such as banks, card networks, and/or payment gateways, and may provide them with some or all of your personal data in order to optimize order approval.
When required for Legal Purposes
We may share your personal data with third parties if we believe it is required by law or for the purpose of exercising legitimate legal rights. For instance, it could be necessary to share your data in order to comply with legal proceedings, to protect or exercise the legal rights of Riskified or our Merchants, or to respond to lawful requests.
With Corporate Group Entities or in a Business Transfer
We may share your personal data with our corporate group entities but their use of such information must comply with the Policy. Your data may also be shared if the operation of the Services is organized within a different framework or through another legal structure or entity, such as due to a merger or acquisition.
Non-Personal Data
We may use the information we collect to compile aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information. We may share de-identified or aggregated information with any number of parties.
With you
Unless otherwise prohibited by our contracts or law, we may share some or all of the data we possess about you with you upon your verifiable request or with other parties at your direction. We may contract with one or more vendors in order to verify your identity. In order to submit a request, please email support@riskified.com.
Transfer of Data Outside Your Territory
We may store and process information in the US, the EU, Israel, and in other countries. We may also process information using cloud services.
We frequently process information under arrangements aimed at providing an adequate level of data protection. This may include processing in countries that the EU has determined maintain adequate data protection, the use of model contract clauses, or other mechanisms. You may contact us as noted below to obtain a copy of the arrangements we use to transfer information outside of the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland.
In certain cases, the laws in some of these countries may nevertheless provide a lesser degree of data protection than the laws of your own country. However, we will transfer your information to entities within other such countries for the purpose of processing as described in this Policy.
LOCATION SPECIFIC INFORMATION
Residents of the European Union
If you are a resident of the
European Economic Area , the UK or Switzerland, or any other territory with similar data protection laws, the following section is applicable to how we collect and manage your personal data.
As a data controller we rely on our legitimate interests to process your information, including the use of our service providers assisting us to deliver the Services. We may also receive your explicit consent through the Merchant Website. The Merchant Website relies on their own valid legal basis for processing your information, which may be in the form of consent, legitimate interest or execution of a contract.
The Merchant Website may, at its own discretion, use Riskifieds Services to make a decision on whether to accept or decline your order based solely on automated processing. It may do so if you have given your consent, if needed to enter into or perform a contract, or if authorized by law. Please direct inquiries concerning approval of your order based solely on automated means to the Merchant Website.
If the law grants you such rights, you may ask to access, correct, or delete your personal data that is stored in our systems. You may also ask for our confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data. Subject to the limitations in law, you may request that we update, correct, or delete inaccurate or outdated information. You may also request that we suspend the use of any personal data that you contest the accuracy of, while we verify the status of that data. You may also be entitled to obtain personal data that you directly provided us and have the right to transmit it to another party. However, we will continue retaining, using and sharing certain information if it is associated with fraudulent activity or to comply with legal obligations.
Several of our data sources are companies operating in countries outside of your local territory or the European Economic Area, in legal environments that may not be adequate by EU data protection standards. You may opt out of having your personal data shared with those data sources. However, opting out may prevent us from providing Services and, as a result, may prevent you from using the Merchant Website. Irrespective of requests to opt out, if your personal data is associated with fraudulent activity we may continue to retain, use and share certain information, in order to prevent unlawful practices.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, you can contact us at: support@riskified.com, our Data Protection Officer at privacy@riskified.com, or our EU representative, Lionheart Squared (Europe) Ltd, at riskified@lionheartsquared.eu; 2 Pembroke House, Upper Pembroke Street 28-32, Dublin, D02 EK84 Ireland. When handling these requests, we may ask for additional information to confirm your identity and your request. In addition, you may also have the right to submit a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority  you can find the relevant contact details
here .
Residents of California
If you reside in California or other jurisdictions where such rights are provided by applicable law, you have specific rights regarding your personal data. This section describes the rights that you have and explains how to exercise those rights.
Right to Know About Personal Data Collected, Disclosed or Sold . Pursuant to theÂ  California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure or sale of your personal data over the past 12 months. However, Riskified is a service provider (as defined under the CCPA) to its Merchants (who are businesses under the CCPA) that use our Services.Â  You should direct your requests to the Merchants with whom you shop, and not to Riskified. As a service provider, when requested, we reasonably assist our Merchants in responding to consumer requests under the CCPA but do not respond to such requests directly. If we receive such requests for personal information when we are merely the service provider, we will advise you to directly contact such Merchants.
Right to Request Deletion.
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal data that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal data from our records. However, we may retain personal data that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us in order to perform certain actions permitted by applicable law, specifically such as detecting data security incidents or protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.Â  Therefore, we may retain your personal data despite such request.
Exercising Access and Deletion Rights.
To exercise the access and deletion rights described above, please submit a request to us by emailing support@riskified.com.
Only you, or a person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an authorized agent), may make the requests set forth above. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.
The request should include your contact information and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. In addition, you should provide sufficient information (including, at minimum, your name, address, and e-mail address) that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the personal data or an authorized representative.
We will respond to consumer requests in a reasonably timely manner. If we require extra time to respond, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
In order to protect the security of your personal data, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal data relates to you. The method used to verify your identity will vary depending on the nature of the request. Generally speaking, verification will be performed by a third-party service provider.
Any disclosures we provide may only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. We are not obligated to provide the information set forth above under  Right to Know About Personal Data Collected, Disclosed or Sold
more than twice in a 12-month period.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Personal Data Sales Opt-Out.
We do not sell information, as sales are defined under applicable laws.
Non-Discrimination.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your legal rights.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We implement industry standard measures to reduce risks caused by the potential loss of information, unauthorized access, or use of information. However, no measure can provide absolute information security and we cannot provide protections beyond what is within our reasonable control.
DATA RETENTION
The personal data we collect is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or any newly developed services under this Policy. We retain the personal data we receive from the Merchant for no more than 48 months, unless you request that we delete this information, or if it is required by us to establish, exercise, or defend against legal claims, or comply with legal obligations, for example, to dispute chargebacks or when the data is associated with fraud. When we dispense with data it is either deleted from our system or anonymized without further notice to you.
POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13, and children under the age of 16 in the EU or California. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal data without their consent, he or she should contact us at support@riskified.com. If we become aware that a child under such ages has provided us with personal data, we will delete such information from our files unless we have appropriate consent, where applicable, or unless we are required to maintain it for law-enforcement or legal purposes
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
If we materially change this Policy in a manner that adversely affects your rights, or the protections afforded to your personal data, such changes will only affect the personal data we collect after the Policy change, unless you agree to us treating the personal data previously collected in accordance with the new Policy.
