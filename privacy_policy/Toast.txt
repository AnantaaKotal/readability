privacy@toasttab.com . Opting out of one communication will not necessarily opt you out of all marketing communications. Please note that you may still receive certain non-marketing communications after opting out. These messages may include transaction-specific communications, messages as part of a loyalty program or account-specific communications. In certain cases, our Merchants may also send you marketing and promotional communications as part of the Services, including when you visit a Merchant using Toast or join a Merchant-specific loyalty program. In these instances, please follow the instructions within those messages or reach out to the Merchant directly.

Links to other websites This Privacy Statement only applies to information collected when visiting our websites or otherwise using our Services. While visiting our websites or using the Services, you may be directed through links to third-party websites or services that are not operated or controlled by us. For example, the websites of our Merchants or business partners that provide services as part of this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of these third parties. As a result, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites as their practices may differ from ours. 11. Children Our Services are not targeted or directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the childs parent or guardian to contact us as described in the How to Contact Us section of this Statement to request that we remove the information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collected has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information. We do, however, process personal information about children when it is necessary for the services we are offering, and you provide it to us. For example, if you are a Merchant Employee, we may collect information relating to children if your employer is using the Toast Payroll and Team Management module and you add them as dependents under your benefits policies. 12.

Categories of personal information sold  Toast does not sell personal information as most individuals would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party advertising partners to collect information about Consumers through our Services for purposes of serving ads that are more relevant and other personalization features, for tracking and analytics, and for fraud detection and reporting. The categories of personal information impacted may include: Identifiers; Internet/Network Information; and Inferences. Each of the above categories of information may be disclosed to our third-party service providers or business partners depending on the nature of a users interaction. To the extent this practice is interpreted to constitute a sale under the CCPA, please see our Privacy Statement section titled Cookies and other tracking technologies for more information including how to exercise your rights to opt-out of cookies, analytics and personalized advertising. To the extent that these practices qualify as sales under the CCPA, you may have the right to opt out as described in the How to invoke your rights section below. Toast has no actual knowledge that the sales described above include the personal information of individuals under 16 years of age. C. Description of rights available to Consumers  A number of individual rights are available to individuals under the CCPA relating to personal information that we have collected (subject to certain limitations at law), including: The right of access : you have the right to request that an in-scope business that collects personal information from you, disclose the following in relation to the preceding 12 month period, upon verification of your identity: (i) the categories of personal information collected about you, (ii) the categories of sources where the personal information was collected, (iii) the business or commercial purposes for collecting (or where applicable, selling) the personal information, (iv) the categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose along with the corresponding recipients, (v) the categories of personal information we have sold along with the corresponding recipients, and (vi) the specific pieces of personal information collected about you. The right of deletion : you have the right to request that an in-scope business delete personal information that it has collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. The right to opt out of personal information sales : you have the right to request that an in-scope business refrain from selling personal information it has collected about you to third parties now or in the future. If you are under the age of 16, you have the right to opt in, or to have a parent or guardian opt in on your behalf, to such sales. The right against discrimination : you have the right to not be discriminated against as a result of exercising any of the above rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you with our Services or engage with you in the same manner. Please note that your ability to invoke the rights above are limited pursuant to the scope and limitations of the CCPA, including any available exceptions. For example, an access request can only be made twice by a Consumer within a 12 month period. D. How to invoke your rights Toast has established an individual rights portal for the purposes of submitting your individual rights requests above. The link to Toasts individual rights portal can be found
here . Individual rights requests can also be submitted to Toast through the below channels: By email:
privacy@toasttab.com By post: Attn: Toast Privacy Office, Toast, Inc., 401 Park Drive, Suite 801 Boston, MA 02215 By phone (toll-free):
(866) 226-4484 Once an individual rights request has been submitted, Toast may ask you for additional information in order to verify your identity or to provide additional details to help us respond to your request. This may include your name, email address, phone number or other details related to your use of Toasts Services. Where applicable, these requests can be submitted by an authorized agent through the channels described above in accordance with the applicable law. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may refuse to act or impose limitations on your rights, as permitted by the applicable law. As noted above, we do not sell personal information as traditionally defined, but certain third-party advertising practices may qualify as "sales" under the CCPA. To the extent applicable, an opt-out mechanism has been provided in the "Categories of personal information sold" section above. You may also exercise your right to opt out of any sales outside this scope by clicking
here . You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your right to opt out of personal information sales. However, if applicable, we may ask you to provide additional personal information so that we can properly identify you in our dataset and to track compliance with your opt out request. We will only use personal information provided in an opt out request to review and comply with the request.
