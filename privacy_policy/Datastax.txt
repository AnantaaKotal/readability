DataStax will ensure that any Data Processor it engages to provide the services on its behalf in connection with the Agreement does so only on the basis of a written contract which imposes on such Data Processor terms substantially no less protective of Personal Data than those imposed on DataStax in this DataStax AppStax DPP. DataStax shall procure the performance by such Data Processor of the Relevant Terms.
Data Transfers
The Customer acknowledges that the provision of DataStax AppStax under the Agreement may require the processing of Personal Data by DataStax and its Data Processor(s) in countries outside the EEA from time to time.

the requirement for DataStax to execute or procure that the third party execute on behalf of the Customer standard contractual clauses approved by the EU authorities under EU Data Protection Laws;
the requirement for the third party to be certified under the Privacy Shield framework; or
the existence of any other specifically approved safeguard for data transfers (as recognised under the EU Data Protection Laws) and/or a European Commission finding of adequacy.
Audit and Records
DataStax shall, in accordance with and to the extent required by EU Data Protection Laws and Clause II(g) of the Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable, make available to the Customer such information in DataStax's possession or control as the Customer may reasonably request and which DataStax is lawfully entitled to disclose with a view to demonstrating DataStax's compliance with the obligations of Data Processors under EU Data Protection Law in relation to its processing of Personal Data.
The Customer where applicable may exercise its right of audit under EU Data Protection Laws and Clause II(g), through DataStax providing:
to Customer a summary of an audit report provided that the applicable audit(s): are performed periodically; are assessed against relevant standards; are conducted by auditor(s) selected by DataStax but otherwise conducted with all due and necessary independence and professionalism; and are documented in a report that affirms that DataStax's controls meet the standards against which they are assessed; and
additional information in DataStax's possession or control to a Supervisory Authority when it requests or requires additional information in relation to the data processing activities carried out by DataStax under this DataStax AppStax DPP, unless DataStax is  prohibited from doing so by applicable laws.

Customer shall promptly notify DataStax with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of a review of the audit summaries and additional information provided by DataStax, and DataStax shall use commercially reasonable efforts to address any confirmed non-compliance.

Section 13 is subject to the Customer and DataStax having an applicable non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement in place, the Customer agrees to enter such an agreement pursuant to exercising its rights under section 13.
Request for Financial Resources Proof
DataStax shall, in accordance with and to the extent required by Clause II(f) of the Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable, make available to the Customer such information in DataStax's possession or control as the Customer may reasonably request and which DataStax is lawfully entitled to disclose with a view to demonstrating DataStax's compliance with the obligations under the Standard Contractual Clauses.
The Customer where applicable may exercise its right that DataStax provide evidence of financial resources sufficient to fulfil its responsibilities under clause III (which may include insurance coverage), under Standard Contractual Clause II(f), through DataStax providing:
to Customer a summary of an insurance policy that is active.
Customer shall promptly notify DataStax with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of reviewing such a summary of an insurance policy as described in section 14.2.1 and DataStax shall use commercially reasonable efforts to address any confirmed non-compliance.
This section does not affect the rights of Data Subjects or Supervisory Authorities under the Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable, nor does it vary or modify the Standard Contractual Clauses where they are applicable.
Section 14 is subject to the Customer and DataStax having an applicable non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement in place, the Customer agrees to enter such an agreement pursuant to exercising its rights under section 14.
Requests for Personal Data
If a government or government agency demands that DataStax supply it with Personal Data as defined in section 3 of this DataStax AppStax DPP, DataStax will attempt to direct the government (or agency) towards making a request directly to the Customer. DataStax may therefore supply the government (or agency) with limited contact information, Account Data that is known or available to DataStax. If compelled by the government (or agency) to disclose Personal Data related to this DataStax AppStax DPP, as defined under section 3, DataStax will first give Customer reasonable notice of this so that Customer may seek a protective, injunctive or other such appropriate judicial or otherwise order, unless DataStax is prohibited by applicable laws from giving Customer such notice. If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, nothing in this section varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses.
Conflict of terms
This DataStax AppStax DPP is without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the parties under the Agreement which shall continue to have full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this DataStax AppStax DPP and the terms of the Agreement, the terms of this DataStax AppStax DPP shall prevail so far as the subject matter concerns the processing of Personal Data within the scope of this DataStax AppStax DPP.
Miscellaneous
If the Customer decides that a Security Breach must be notified to any Supervisory Authority and/or Data Subjects and/or the public or portions of the public, the Customer will notify DataStax before the communication is made and supply DataStax with copies of any written documentation to be filed with the Supervisory Authority and of any notification the Customer proposes to make (whether to any Supervisory Authority, Data Subjects the public or portions of the public) which references DataStax, its security measures and/or role in the Security Breach, whether or not by name. Subject to the Customer's compliance with any mandatory notification deadlines under the GDPR, the Customer will consult with DataStax in good faith and take account of any clarifications or corrections DataStax reasonably requests to such notifications and which are consistent with the GDPR.
DataStax's liability to the Customer and Customer Group under or in connection with this DataStax AppStax DPP (including under the Standard Contractual Clauses incorporated via section 12 of this DataStax AppStax DPP) shall be subject to the same limitations and exclusions of liability as apply under the Agreement as if that liability arose under the Agreement.  Nothing in this DataStax AppStax DPP will limit DataStax's liability in respect of personal injury or death in negligence or for any other liability or loss which may not be limited by agreement under applicable law.
