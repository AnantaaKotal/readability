We protect all PHI in accordance with all applicable laws and the requirements imposed by your Sponsor.
C. Retention
We retain Personal Information after we cease providing Services to you for the purpose of fraud monitoring, detection and prevention. We also retain Personal Information to comply with our tax, accounting, and financial reporting obligations, where we are required to retain the data by our contractual commitments (e.g. with your Sponsor or a Connect Partner), and where data retention is otherwise mandated by law. Where we retain data, we do so in accordance with any limitation periods and records retention obligations that are imposed by applicable law. Please note that we may delete your Personal Information upon the request of your Sponsor or if we are otherwise contractually or legally obligated to do so.
If you have consented to receive marketing materials from us, we will retain your Personal Information for as long as we have your consent to send you marketing materials. Additionally, we indefinitely retain data that is anonymized, de-identified, and/or aggregated in a manner that removes identifiable Personal Information from it.
