It is important that you read the Privacy Policy along with the Lookout Terms of Service (available at www.lookout.com/uk/legal/consumer-terms) because both apply to your use of the Lookout Personal App. Our Privacy Policy applies to our websites and mobile websites including at www.lookout.com, our Lookout Personal App, and all other Lookout services provided as part of the Lookout Personal App (as that term is defined in our Terms of Service).  The Lookout Enterprise Mobile Endpoint Security product privacy policy is described in the Lookout Enterprise Privacy Statement. This Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of Personal Data (PD). Personal Data (PD) collected from you includes data elements such as your name, email address, phone number and/or your mobile device’s unique identifier, among other things. The term Personal Data also encompasses personally identifiable information and personal data as defined in the GDPR General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”).  Lookout reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our services, or advances in technology. Please check this document or web pages provided on Lookout.com periodically for changes. By continuing to use our services, you accept those changes and agree to be bound by the updated policy. Please contact us at privacy@lookout.com if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy. This policy can be accessed from the Lookout mobile application login screen, from the settings in the Lookout Personal App, and from our company’s website.                Products Offered in the Lookout Personal App  Lookout offers multiple tiers within the Lookout Personal App.  Each tier offers increased access to Lookout security features.  The information required to provide these services may vary and is listed in this document to help you understand what information we collect directly from you, from your device and how we use this information. Details regarding product features for the Lookout Personal App for iOS and Android devices can be found here https://www.lookout.com/uk/products/personal/ios and https://www.lookout.com/uk/products/personal/android.  1. We Collect Information From You to Provide You with Lookout Services When we collect your information, we store it and associate it with your account unless otherwise noted. We take your privacy very seriously and will only use and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy. Some of our products are standalone products, and collect only limited information or no information at all. Feature availability will vary by product, and country. Therefore, not every section of this Privacy Policy will apply to these products. Please note that we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Lookout Services to you.  If you do not provide us with such information, or ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access the Lookout Services.  Please note, our purpose in collecting application data and security scan data is to provide you with protections to help keep you and your data safe.  This is also to optimise and improve our Lookout Services. Lookout collects data about your device, which includes make, model, OS type and revision, as well as what applications have been installed. This data is de-identified and is combined with the de-identified data from other customers to produce popularity of devices in applications by region. This data will remain de-identified to ensure personal data privacy.  Combining customer data in a secure and confidential way helps Lookout to better understand current security threats.  This also helps to improve the Lookout Security features and services. We may also share reports resulting from this data analysis publicly, in order to help others understand mobile threats and gain insights into particular mobile application behaviour.  2. Information Lookout Collects for the Lookout Basic Personal App  a. Registration Information To create an account, you must provide an email address and a password. b. Device Information When you use Lookout Services, our servers record certain information about your mobile device. This information may include an equipment identifier (e.g. IMEI, subscriber identifier (e.g. IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, operating system type and version, wireless carrier/operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the dates and times of your requests. We also collect information about the applications on your device in order to conduct scans and to download copies of scanned application files. This may include downloading a copy of part or entire copies of application files on your device if we encounter an application that we have not previously analysed. We may also collect information about how applications behave on your device (e.g. whether an application is sending premium-rate text messages that may charge money to your phone bill) and the network services with which your applications communicate, in order to determine if any applications are behaving maliciously (e.g. whether an application is talking to a server known to host phishing websites). Each time Lookout performs a scan, we collect information that describes what application files are identified by the scan as potentially undesirable. Lookout then provides recommended choices for remediation of those files (e.g. uninstall or ignore).  We use the information described above to provide our services, and support if needed. We also aggregate information about mobile threat analysis. Information maintained in aggregate is de-identified to ensure an individual cannot be identified.  To find out more about Lookout mobile threat analysis go to https://www.lookout.com/why-lookout.  c. Location Information Some features we offer work better if we can locate your mobile device. With your consent, which is provided during initial registration, Lookout may collect location information in two ways. We may receive it directly from your mobile device, or, in some situations, we may receive location data from cell tower or Wi-Fi hotspot information. We may use third-party service providers to translate that information into usable location information. To prevent location data from being shared go to your mobile device settings and turn off location services.  d. URLs To provide the Safe Browsing service, we may transmit the URLs you receive or visit on your phone to a Lookout-provided or third-party service to determine if those URLs are unsafe (e.g. if the URLs contain phishing attacks, malware or exploits). If a URL you visit is determined to be unsafe, we store a record of the unsafe URL. We use the record of unsafe URLs you visit (1) to provide you with a notice that the URL you attempted to reach is unsafe (e.g. when you log in to the Lookout website or via email) and (2) to improve our product and conduct analysis. If you do not want us to record the unsafe URLs you visit, you may turn Safe Browsing off; all other Lookout features will continue to function. 3. Features Offered in the Lookout Personal App a. Security  Lookout’s Security features, which are available on different platforms, help protect your device from cybersecurity threats.  Information required to support these features is collected when you use the Lookout App. Details about this information are provided in the Device Information section of this document.      Lookout’s Security features, which differ by platform, provide security by various means which include scanning for malicious apps and files and detecting an out-of-date OS.  More information on Lookout’s predictive security technology can be found at www.lookout.com. Automatic scans of your device may occur periodically to collect details about the applications, device and operating system files on your device.  Lookout will gather the results of scans performed by our services and the most current security disposition of the device. In addition, regular updates of threat definitions will be performed. These activities help to protect your mobile endpoint by allowing the Lookout App to detect and address threats on your mobile device. This feature can be turned on or off via the Lookout App Settings.  b. Missing Device Lookout’s Theft Protection features include Missing Device capabilities such as the ability to Locate and Scream your device remotely from your Personal account at lookout.com.  The Signal Flare feature will help you locate your phone near its last known location if you lose it and its battery dies. If you have enabled Signal Flare, it collects location information and sends it back to Lookout when your battery is running low. We save the phone's location to lookout.com at the time we receive the low battery alert. This feature can be turned on or off via the Lookout App Settings. When you activate the Missing Device features, your browser will send location information to third-party map providers (e.g. Google Maps) in order to display a map of the location within your Personal account at lookout.com. When activating this feature, we track the device’s location for several minutes in order to provide an accurate location of your device for you. This information is retained in your account history and may be deleted by you at any time, from your account settings. If you choose to delete this information or disable your account, Lookout de-identifies this data so that it is no longer associated with your personal data.  c. Backup (Contacts) Lookout Backup allows users to back up their contacts. This information will be transmitted to servers using an encrypted protocol and stored in the Lookout Cloud.  Information can be accessed or deleted by logging into your account at Lookout.com. This feature can be turned on or off via the Lookout App Settings.  d. Multiple Device Support  Multiple Device Support links multiple devices to one master account that controls the Master Account owner’s device as well as certain features of devices associated with the Master Account. Master Account owners have control over some functions of the additional devices. For example, in a multiple device account, a user may locate or access backup data on any devices enrolled under the same account.   4. Information Lookout Collects for our Premium Services in the Personal App  a. Information Collected When Upgrading to Premium Services Lookout collects the same information stated in the Lookout Basic Personal App; registration information, device information; location information (if necessary). In addition to this information, Lookout will also collect payment information to allow you to access premium features.   b. Payment Information If you purchase a Premium or Premium Plus Lookout Service subscription directly from us, we use a third-party payment processor to collect your credit card information including your credit card number, expiry date, security code and other applicable billing information. Our third-party vendor will use this information to bill you for services. Lookout will have information regarding your Premium and/or Premium Plus account.  This information will include the amount you paid and the method of payment. We will not have your credit card or bank information, this information remains with the third-party payment processor.   If you purchase the Lookout App from an App Store or through your Carrier plan your payment information will be managed by that App Store or Carrier. Payment does not go to Lookout. Your payment could be processed in various ways. Lookout has contract agreements in place with our Partners to ensure that you receive the expected Lookout Mobile App performance. In order to provide our services to you, the App Store will send Lookout confirmation of your purchase. Carriers may share your phone number, subscriber ID, SKU and other non-financial information. The App Store and your Carrier will not share credit card or billing data. For additional information, please refer to your App Store or Carrier's payment processing policies and procedures. c. Theft Alerts Data Collection When Theft Alerts is activated a photo is taken. The picture and location data (GPS location) are stored briefly on our servers so we can send you an email with the picture and a map of your device’s location. The picture is then deleted from our server. We send the email to the address associated with your account so remember to keep your email address up to date in your account settings. We use information about Theft Alert’s activities on your device to study, optimise and troubleshoot our products. d. Safe Browsing Safe Browsing is a feature designed to identify and warn you of unsafe URLs so that you can choose to avoid loading them. Safe Browsing is available when you have allowed the app to run a local VPN. Using the VPN, the Safe Browsing feature scans URLs that are being accessed by your device via browsers and apps. URLs visited are anonymised and sent to the Lookout Cloud to perform security scans. URL paths are the only data related to your browsing activity that is sent to Lookout. Lookout does not collect browsing history or any other personal information. 5. Features Provided with the Lookout Premium Service  In addition to the basic features described above, Lookout Premium customers will gain access to new features and feature enhancements.  a. Missing Device Premium subscribers to Lookout receive additional capabilities in the Missing Device feature. The ability to Lock and Wipe the device remotely is provided from your Personal account at lookout.com. b. Theft Alerts Theft Alerts is a Premium feature within Theft Protection. Theft Alerts allows you to locate your phone when lost.  When these features are enabled, an email will be sent to you on selected events (e.g. Airplane Mode enabled) with the location of your device. On Android devices, the email includes a photo of the person who may have stolen it using your device’s camera and location features to help you figure out where your device might be (and who might have it) in the event that your device is lost or stolen. You can view the location of your device by logging into your account on Lookout.com. These features will use the location data of your device, email and phone number you provided to Lookout from the device and will help you to recover your phone in the event it is lost. c. Backup (Call Logs and Photos) Backup of Call Logs and Photos is supported for Premium subscribers. You can then access your photos through your Personal account on Lookout.com.  Your photos and backed-up data can be deleted from your Lookout account at any time. d. Safe Browsing Safe Browsing is a feature designed to identify and warn you of unsafe URLs so that you can choose to avoid loading them. Safe Browsing is available when you have allowed the app to run a local VPN. Using the VPN, the Safe Browsing feature scans URLs that are being accessed by your device via browsers and apps. URLs visited are anonymised and sent to the Lookout Cloud to perform security scans. URL paths are the only data related to your browsing activity that is sent to Lookout. Lookout does not collect browsing history or any other personal information. e. Safe Wi-Fi With Safe Wi-Fi, Lookout analyses your Wi-Fi connection for unusual activity indicating the network is unsafe or under attack and alerts you.  Safe Wi-Fi helps prevent attackers from accessing your personal data on your mobile endpoint. f. Breach Report (Available in English only) With Breach Report, Lookout can alert you to relevant breaches with clear and simple actions you can take to protect yourself.  You can customise alerts to be specific to companies or industries and you will also receive recommendations on what actions to take to protect your data and identity.   g. How to Turn Features Off If you choose, you can turn features off using the Lookout settings.  For issues and enquiries please contact support@lookout.com.  6. Information Collected with Lookout Premium Plus (US only)  The information we collect will depend on the types of Premium Plus identity protection products you enrol in. This information is required in order to verify your identity, provide you with the requested Identity Protection Services, and charge you the agreed-upon fees.

Requests can be submitted by contacting support@lookout.com.
