Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 28, 2020
Privacy Policy
1.     Introduction
The EU General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) came into force on 25 May 2018. The Regulation aims to standardize data protection laws and processing across the EU, giving people greater rights to access and control their personal information.
In addition, you are probably already familiar with the California Privacy act ( CCPA) , the effective date is quickly approaching. As a reminder, the CCPA requires covered businesses (like most of our customers) to provide California residents substantially increased notice, access, and control of their personal information.
For an overview of
GDPR
&
CCPA , please see the following resources:
CCPA Fact Sheet
United Kingdoms Information Commissioners Office
The intent of this privacy brief is to provide an update regarding Navisites current posture on certain aspects of the privacy laws as they apply to Navisite and the services we provide to you.
2.     Our Commitment
Navisite is committed to conducting its business in accordance with applicable data privacy laws and regulations and in line with the highest standard of ethical conduct to ensure protection of individuals and customers information. Data
Confidentiality ,
Integrity
and
Availability
are our founding values.
We have always had a robust and effective data protection program in place which complies with existing laws and abides by the data protection principles. However, we recognize our obligations in updating and expanding this program to meet the demands of the
GDPR
and
CCPA .
3.     Our mission
Navisites compliance and privacy mission is to establish a worldwide baseline standard for processing and protection of Personal Data by all Navisite Entities.
Navisite (as a processor/service provider) believes that a strong partnership with our clients (as controllers/businesses) is an important part of the compliance relationship process. Navisite believes in being transparent with our clients as to our information security and data privacy practices.
Since Navisite is not a public authority or body and do not collect special category data which includes:
Data related to racial or ethnic origin
Data related to political opinions
Data related to religious or philosophical beliefs
Data related to trade union membership
Genetic data
Biometric data (where used for identification purposes)
Data concerning health
Data concerning a persons sex life; and
Data concerning a persons sexual orientation.
4.     How we prepare for GDPR and CCPA
Navisite already have a consistent level of data protection and security across our organization, but we will introduce measures to ensure compliance:
Information audit:
carrying out a company-wide information audit to identify and assess what personal information we hold, where it comes from, how and why it is processed and if and to whom it is disclosed.
Documented policies and procedures:
We will revise data protection policies and procedures to meet the requirements and standards for GDPR and CCPA.
Privacy Policy/Notice:
we will revise our Privacy Notice(s) to comply with the GDPR, ensuring that all individuals whose personal information we process have been informed of why we need it, how it is used, what their rights are, who the information is disclosed to and what safeguarding measures are in place to protect their information.
Obtaining Consent : we will review our consent mechanisms for obtaining personal data, ensuring that individuals understand what they are providing, why and how we use it and giving clear, defined ways to consent to us processing their information
Direct Marketing : we have revised the wording and processes for direct marketing, including clear opt-in mechanisms for marketing subscriptions; a clear notice and method for opting out and providing unsubscribe features on all subsequent marketing materials.
Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)
 where we process personal information that is considered high risk, we will develop stringent procedures for carrying out impact assessments that comply fully with the GDPRs Article 35 requirements. We have implemented documentation processes that record each assessment, allow us to rate the risk posed by the processing activity and implement mitigating measures to reduce the risk posed to the data subject(s).
Processor Agreements : where we use any third-party to process personal information on our behalf (i.e. Payroll, Recruitment, Hosting, etc), we will draft compliant Processor Agreements and due diligence procedures for ensuring that they meet and understand their/our GDPR obligations.
5.     Information Security and Technical Measures
Navisites compliance program follows a process approach to ensure we demonstrate compliance with regulation and provide our customers assurances in relation to how we handle their personal data.
Navisite is in the process to build its information security (ISO/IEC 27002) and risk management (ISO/IEC 31000) frameworks to protect personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction.
6.     Data Subject Rights
