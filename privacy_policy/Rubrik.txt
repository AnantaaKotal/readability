Supplemental European Privacy Statement
As of May 25, 2018, European Union Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (EU GDPR), requires us as the data controller of the Online Services to provide additional and different information about our data processing practices to data subjects in the European Economic Area (EEA). If you are accessing our Online Services from a member state of the EEA, this Supplemental European Privacy Statement applies to you in addition to the Privacy Policy above.
Cookies.  With respect to web cookies and similar technologies that are not strictly necessary for our provision of the Online Services, Rubrik seeks consent from users of the Service in the EEA based on a separate  Cookies Policy .
Legal Basis of Processing.  The legal basis for Rubriks processing of your personal data in connection with our Online Services is Article 6(1)(b) of the EU GDPR, which allows processing of personal data as necessary for the performance of a contract. When you access, use or register for our Online Services, you form a contract with Rubrik based on the applicable terms of service, and we need to process your personal data to respond to your requests, provide our Online Services and satisfy our obligations with respect to the other purposes listed in the Privacy Policy above.
Rubrik also relies on your consent with respect to cookies that are not strictly necessary and direct marketing emails per Article 6(1)(a) of the EU GDPR; and pursues legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the EU GDPR with respect to situations where Rubrik needs to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws (as a U.S.-based company, Rubrik, Inc. is subject to U.S. laws and must comply with them), provide good customer service, or improve our products and services. In these cases, we will ensure that your privacy and other fundamental interests do not override our legitimate interests.
Personal Data Transfers outside of the EEA.  Rubrik transmits some of your personal data to the following countries where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction. For all transfers of your information from the EEA or Switzerland to the US, Rubrik is certified under Privacy Shield and follows its principles. To view a list of Privacy Shield participants please visit the  Privacy Shield website .
Furthermore, Rubrik complies with the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States. Rubrik has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit the   Privacy Shield website .
Where Rubrik shares information we receive under Privacy Shield with third parties, we're responsible for ensuring those third parties also comply with Privacy Shield, unless we can prove we're not responsible for the damaging event.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Rubrik commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EEA or Switzerland individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at  privacy@rubrik.com . Rubrik has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to TRUSTe Dispute Resolution, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit our U.S. based third party dispute resolution provider TRUSTe  here  for more information or to file a complaint. The services of TRUSTe are provided at no cost to you. In certain circumstances, and if the dispute resolution process still doesnt resolve the problem, EEA individuals may pursue binding arbitration through a process described  here . Rubrik is also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
Any onward transfer is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.
Data Retention . Rubrik keeps personal data as long as required to provide our Online Services to you and comply with applicable laws. For example, if you register for an account on the Online Services, we retain your personal data for as long as you have an account with us and then for only as long as required for us to comply with applicable laws, discharge our contractual obligations to you, or defend our legal interests in connection with any claim or defense we could face before any formal dispute resolution body. We take reasonable measures to ensure that personal data is deleted, erased or anonymized as soon as possible once the purposes for which personal data was collected have been fulfilled.
Data Subject Rights.  You have a right to request from Rubrik access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data. You also have the right to request the restriction of processing concerning you, in which case such personal data would be marked and processed by us only for certain purposes. In addition, you have the right to data portability, which allows you to receive from us personal data about you which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to transmit such personal data to another entity without hindrance from us.
You also have the right to object to various data processing activities, including processing activities that are based exclusively on your consent or processing for the purposes of direct marketing. You can exercise such rights by accessing the information in your account and/or by emailing  privacy@rubrik.com . Please note that these rights may be subject to limitations and conditions under the EU GDPR or applicable national data protection laws.
If you have provided consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary or other data processing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Your Choices.  You are not required to provide any personal data to Rubrik, but if you do not provide any personal data to Rubrik, you may not be able to use our Online Services or conduct business with us effectively. You can use our Online Services without consenting to cookies that are not strictly necessary; the only consequence is that our Online Services will be less tailored to you. You can exercise your choices by accessing the information in your account and/or by emailing  privacy@rubrik.com .
Profiling.  Rubrik does not use in connection with our Online Services automated decision-making in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or which significantly affects you.
