A Website also may collect information about the types of devices used to access the Website.  This information helps us to understand how users are using the Websites and how we can improve the Websites and our service offerings. This information also may be used by AvidXchange and its service providers to better market the Services, analyze trends, administer the Websites, diagnose technical problems, derive each users approximate location, calculate user levels, perform audits, and security and fraud monitoring and detection. Your browser may have an option that allows you to accept cookies, reject cookies, or receive notification when a cookie is sent, but you should note that the use of such restrictive browser settings may limit the functionality and your use of the Websites. With this information, we can also track user movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information.   AvidXchange shares this information on an aggregated anonymized data with its partners and advertisers but does not associate that information with individual usernames without consent of the user. The users of the Websites and the Services are generally businesses or other non-person legal entities. While most of the information AvidXchange receives and collects is not of a personal nature, portions of the information we receive may include public and Non-public Personally Identifiable information (NPI) about individuals. Additionally, we use applications of, and may contract with, service providers for reporting purposes and to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business. You may block certain cookies through your browser settings. Note that information may be collected before the cookie is disabled. Authentication cookies last for a short period (generally less than a day). Users may opt-in with the remember me option to have authentication cookies saved for up to 24 hours. Cookies also can be removed from the hard drive of a users computer. Users should check with their browser provider for more information related to removing cookies. We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of our Website (such as how often users visit this site and what pages they visit) and report on activities and trends. Google Analytics collects specific information such as IP address rather than your name or other personally identifying information. Google does put a cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site. You can learn about Googles practices by going to
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners
( http://www.google.com/ policies/privacy/partners ) and opt-out from the collection of your information by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (gtag.js, ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) that is running on websites from sharing information with Google Analytics about visit activity.

Usage Information helps AvidXchange measure the success of the Website and its features or pages and to improve your online experience, as well as to optimize the Services. The information may also be used for records administration, accounting and funding activities, enforcing our site policies, and compliance with laws and regulations. AvidXchange (and its affiliates and service providers) may disclose any information that it collects and retains when we believe we are required to do so in order to comply with the law or regulation (including foreign laws applicable to our affiliates and service providers), enforce our policies, to defend against legal claims, to address misuse of the Website (including without limitation unauthorized access to any system, spamming, denial of service attacks or similar attacks), or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.
