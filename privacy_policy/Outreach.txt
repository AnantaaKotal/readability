Privacy Policy
Some Notes On Our Relationship
This Privacy Statement applies to " www.outreach.io " and the customer engagement platform service at
accounts.outreach.io
("Outreach Service" or "the Service"), which are owned and operated by Outreach Corporation (Outreach). At Outreach, we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of any personal information about our users. Your privacy is always at the top of our priorities, and we are focused on protecting it from unauthorized access.
This Privacy Policy supplements our End User License Agreement (EULA)/ Terms of Service
and spells out how we collect, use, and disclose information from or about you through our website
www.outreach.io
and the Outreach Service. Users can access the Outreach Service via our website
www.outreach.io ,
accounts.outreach.io , applications on Devices, APIs, and third-parties. A "Device" is any device used to access the Outreach Service, including without limitation a computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other electronic device. By using our Service, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Outreach client ("Client") has engaged Outreach.
Outreach participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. Outreach is committed to subjecting all personal data received from the Swiss Confederation (Switzerland) and European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the respective Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the Frameworks applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the
U.S. Department of Commerces Privacy Shield program site .
Outreach is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Outreach complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU or Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Outreach is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Outreach may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request .
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the
Privacy Shield website , you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
The Information We Collect and Store
Outreach employees are prohibited from viewing the content of the data you import into your Outreach account, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. Of course, in the case that you request our help to resolve your support issues relating to that data, and only after receiving your permission, Outreach employees may access the relevant data.
We may collect and store the following information when running the Outreach Service:
Information You provide
When you register for an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, email address, and home and/or business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts and email history by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. In fact, in order to use our Service, you must link a third party email account to your Outreach account. We then import, create, and update versions of your address book and emails for you to access in Outreach. You will also have the option to import and update versions of your calendar, social media contacts, and mobile phone call history, and you can later choose to upload files to, or provide comments through, Outreach. When you invite others to join Outreach by using the Service, we send them an email for that invitation at the email addresses assigned to them in your address book.
When we configure and customize deals, or manage and perform recurring billing, we may also ask you to provide information such as your bank account number; credit card number; national ID number, insurance number, social security number; taxpayer identification number, tax file number, passport number, and driver's license number.
Collection and Use of 3rd Party Personal Information
You may also provide personal information about other people, such as their email address. This information is only used for the sole purpose of completing your request or for whatever reason it may have been provided.
If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at support@outreach.io.
Your Data and Other Information About You
With your permission (which you grant when you sign up for or begin using our Service), Outreach collects and stores information you provide or that we collect in order to administer our Services and/or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. If you or another user uploads a file to Outreach that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with the applicable accounts rather than storing duplicates.
User Data Supplementation
We may receive additional demographic information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
Outreach obtains this business contact and company information from third party sources, such as business intelligence platforms. The information obtained by these third-party sources is from publicly available sources such as news articles. This information is used to support Outreachs marketing and sales efforts. The Outreach sales team may contact you based on this information to gauge your companys interest in Outreachs services and technology solutions. You may opt-out of these communications at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link provided in the email or by sending a request to the Outreach Technical Support team by emailing
support@outreach.io .
Log Data

Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
Personal Information is or may be used for the following purposes:
To provide and improve our Service.
To administer your use of the Service
To recommend follow-up reminders, assign tasks, or personalize the service,

Information Sharing and Disclosure by Us (Do Not Sell My Information)
We do not sell Personal Information to third parties.
If you are a California resident our default cookie settings may constitute a sale of personal information. You can change your cookie settings under the Cookies section above.
Service Providers, Business Partners and Others
We may use certain trusted third-party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service's features). These third parties may have access to your information for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon's S3 storage service to store some of your information (for example, your files). You can find more information on Amazon's data security from the S3 site.
Third-Party Applications
Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Outreach. As of the date this policy went into effect, Outreach has never and will not share your information with a third-party application. If you submit personal information to any of those websites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. In the future, with your consent, we may share your information with a third-party application (for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application). We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy that is acceptable to you.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Outreach's Rights
We may disclose to third parties data stored in your Outreach account and information about you that we collect only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy and when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request, such as to comply with a subpoena; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Outreach or its users; or (d) to protect Outreach's rights. If we provide any data stored in your Outreach account to a law enforcement agency, we will remove Outreach's encryption from the information before providing it to law enforcement. However, Outreach will not be able to decrypt anything that you encrypted prior to uploading it to Outreach.
Business Transfers
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email, sign in notification, and/or a prominent notice on our website) if that happens or if your information otherwise becomes subject to a different privacy policy in lieu of this one. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.
Changing or Deleting Your Information
Upon request Outreach will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct, or delete certain Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your account settings. If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, you may update or delete it by making the change in your account settings, although (in some cases) we may retain copies of your information if required by law, to protect our rights, or if it is not technically reasonably feasible to remove it. You may at any time withdraw any consent that you have provided to us to process your information, or exercise any of the following rights by contacting us as provided below. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request, for security purposes.

Our intention is to retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you Services, you may delete your account. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically reasonably feasible to remove it. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, that Outreach may retain your personal data for longer where there is a legal obligation, contractual, or legitimate interest, unless these interests are overridden by the individuals fundamental rights; in those cases data will be removed once it is no longer needed for those purposes.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
