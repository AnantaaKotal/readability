OUR USE OF COOKIES
We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information related to your use of our Site. We may combine this information with other information we collect from you, and our third-party service providers may also do so on our behalf.
Cookies.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computers hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while others are used to allow us to track your activities related to our Site. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.
Session Cookies.
Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
Persistent Cookies.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity and to display advertising on third-party sites.
Disabling Cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. On most browsers, the Help portion of the toolbar will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function properly.
Local Storage Objects.
We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (Flash LSOs) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose Global Storage Settings Panel, and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose Website Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computers hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
Third-Party Analytics.
We use automated devices and applications provided by third parties, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other, third-party provided analytic means to evaluate our Site. We use these tools to help us improve our Site, performance, and user experiences. The entities providing these tools may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.
Do-Not-Track.
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser do-not-track requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third-Party Ad Networks section. More information about our use of these mechanisms can be found in our cookie notice available here.
Cookie Notice
THIRD-PARTY AD NETWORKS
We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third partys specific privacy policy rather than this Policy.
Users in the US may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding use of your information by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Consumer Opt Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding use of your information by NAI members.
Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt Out Page will opt you out from those companies delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAAs website at https://youradchoices.com/ or the NAIs website at https://www.networkadvertising.org/
THIRD-PARTY LINKS
Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.
SECURITY OF MY INFORMATION
We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions designed to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
CHILDREN
The Site is not for use by children under the age of eighteen (18) years and Pindrop does not knowingly collect, store, share, or use the information of children under eighteen (18) years. If you are under the age of 18 years, please do not provide any information about yourself, even if prompted by the Site to do so. If you are under the age of 18 years and you have provided such information, please ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) to notify Pindrop and Pindrop will delete all such information.
MARKETING
SMS and Emails.
Where lawful to do so, and subject to your consent where required, we may communicate with you by SMS and email to tell you about our solutions and services. If you wish to opt out of receiving marketing communications, please use the unsubscribe link provided in our emails or text the STOP number in our SMS, or otherwise contact us directly and we will stop sending you communications as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ten (10) days from receipt of your request.
Promotional Email.
We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt out of promotional emails by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process opt-out requests.
