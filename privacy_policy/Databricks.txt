This Privacy Policy does not cover any other data submitted through or otherwise made available to the Databricks Platform Services (known as Databricks and Databricks Community Edition, each located at *.cloud.databricks.com, or the related website at
help.databricks.com
and platform support services, together the Platform Services), which are subject to the
Databricks Terms of Service
(or with respect to the Community Edition, the

Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations relating to such Customers use or collection of personal data in connection with the use of our Platform Services by individuals with whom our Customers interact.

with our affiliates and subsidiaries;
with businesses and service providers that help us conduct our business, subject to confidentiality obligations and the requirement that those businesses and service providers do not sell your personal data;
to identify your public contributions; for example, if you post a package on spark-packages.org

where you have instructed us to share your personal data, such as to provide you with support;
when authorized by law or necessary to comply with a legal process;
when required to protect and defend the rights or property of Databricks, our Customers, vendors or other users of our Sites, including the security of our Sites, products and services (including the Platform Services);

Rights of Access, Modification, Deletion and Restriction of Your Information.
If you are located in certain parts of the world, including the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and certain other legal jurisdictions (for example California), you may have certain rights in relation to certain of your personal data. Those rights may include asking us to provide information (including categories of sources), access, export, modification, deletion, or to restrict processing of certain of your personal data. If you wish to exercise these rights:
and you are an individual user of our Community Edition services, please contact us at
ce-dsr@databricks.com
with your request with the subject Community Edition Data Subject Request;
and you are an individual user of a Customer account, please route your request through the appropriate Customer and ask that the administrator of the account send us an email at
dsr@databricks.com
with the subject Data Subject Request. Please note that we cannot process your request directly, as your information is controlled by that Subscriber, and we do not directly have a relationship with you;
and you are a California consumer, please send us an email at
california-dsr@databricks.com
with the subject CCPA Rights Request;
and you believe we have your personal data for some other reason, including if you registered for one of our events, please contact us at

Where allowed, we may ask you to provide your government identification to verify your account. Personal data you provide to us for verification will only be used to verify and maintain records regarding your request.
We will endeavor to promptly respond to your request. Although Databricks makes good faith efforts to provide users of our Sites and Platform Services with access to their personal data, there may be circumstances in which Databricks is unable to provide access including but not limited to: where the information is legally privileged, would compromise the privacy or other legitimate rights of others, where the burden or expense of providing the information would be disproportionate to the risks to the Users privacy in the case in question, where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or where the information is proprietary. If you request deletion of your personal data, please note that we may continue to retain certain of your personal data in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required or allowed by law.
How long do we store your information?
Databricks may retain the personal data we collect from you as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue our legitimate interests, for our business or commercial purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
What steps do we take to secure your Information?
Databricks considers protecting the security of your data to be its number one responsibility.
Databricks has received certification to the internationally recognized industry standard information security management system,
ISO27001 , and aligns its security practices to the internationally recognized industry standard code of practice for protecting personal data in the cloud, ISO27018.
Databricks encrypts communications you make with our Sites and the Platform Services, for example, entering your username and password or information into forms, using TLS (transport layer security) or other industry standard technologies.

What about international data transfer?
Databricks may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one from which you provide it to us.

E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield . To comply with European Union and Swiss data protection laws, Databricks adheres to and has self-certified to the EUU.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States. Once the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State of the European Union, Databricks will comply with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield in respect of the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the United Kingdom to the United States in reliance on the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield until such time as a successor framework or other transfer mechanism exists between the U.S. and the U.K.
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or Switzerland and feel that Databricks is not abiding by the terms of the Privacy Policy, or is not in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, please contact
privacy@databricks.com
with the subject Privacy Shield. Databricks will respond to any such requests within 45 days. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our US-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim . If neither Databricks nor our dispute resolution provider resolves your complaint, you may have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.
